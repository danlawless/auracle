## Section A: Source Currency (Q1-Q5)

### Q1: Crisis Hotline Verification

**Context:** Crisis resources must be current and accurate.

**The Question:** Have all US and international hotlines been verified within the last 90 days?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) All verified current
- [ ] B) US verified, international needs check
- [ ] C) Need full verification pass
- [ ] D) Add "verified as of [date]" disclaimer

**Editor Comments:**
Round 3 verified US hotlines as of December 31, 2025 (4 days before Round 3 report). Key numbers verified:
- National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233
- Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
- National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988
- Trevor Project: 1-866-488-7386
- Trans Lifeline: 1-877-565-8860

For Round 4, these should be spot-checked again, especially if significant time has passed since Round 3 implementation. **Recommendation:** Establish annual verification protocol for all crisis resources.

**Editor Reasoning:**
A reader calling a disconnected hotline in crisis could be life-threatening. This is the highest-stakes factual content in the book.

### Q2: International Resource Coverage

**Context:** Round 3 expanded international resources significantly.

**The Question:** Have all international hotline numbers been individually verified?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) All international numbers verified
- [ ] B) Need verification for expanded list
- [ ] C) Add HotPeachPages.net reference as backup
- [ ] D) Remove unverified numbers

**Editor Comments:**
Round 3 noted the manuscript now includes extensive international coverage: UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa (English-speaking), plus Latin America, Asia & Pacific, and Africa & Middle East. The Round 3 report asked: "Have all international hotline numbers been verified as current?" and suggested a disclaimer like: "Note: International hotline numbers were current as of [date]. Consult HotPeachPages.net for updated information."

**Editor Reasoning:**
International resources vary in stability. A general backup reference (HotPeachPages.net is the gold standard for international abuse resources) provides safety net for readers when specific numbers change.

### Q3: TTY/Accessibility Numbers

**Context:** Deaf and hard-of-hearing readers need verified TTY resources.

**The Question:** Have TTY numbers been verified?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) All TTY numbers verified
- [ ] B) Need verification
- [ ] C) Add verification date notation
- [ ] D) Include general TTY relay service info as backup

**Editor Comments:**
Accessibility resources were newly added based on sensitivity reader feedback. TTY numbers and video relay services change more frequently than voice lines. Verify: (1) Each TTY number listed is current, (2) Consider adding the standard relay service number (711) as a backup that works regardless of specific hotline TTY status.

**Editor Reasoning:**
Deaf survivors are already underserved. Inaccurate TTY information adds another barrier to help.

### Q4: Bibliography Currency

**Context:** Psychological research evolves constantly.

**The Question:** Is the bibliography current through 2025?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Bibliography is current through 2025
- [ ] B) Need to add recent publications
- [ ] C) Need "Bibliography current as of [date]" notation
- [ ] D) Bibliography is appropriately comprehensive

**Editor Comments:**
Round 3 noted the bibliography was expanded with 2020-2025 publications. For Round 4, verify: (1) No significant 2025 publications are missing (especially any new trauma bonding or coercive control research), (2) Classic sources (Winnicott, Bowlby, Walker, Herman) are properly cited, (3) The bibliography supports the claims made without overwhelming general readers.

**Editor Reasoning:**
The bibliography serves two audiences: survivors wanting validation that this is "real" and professionals/academics wanting to go deeper. Both need current, comprehensive sources.

### Q5: Website/URL Verification

**Context:** URLs may become outdated or change.

**The Question:** Have all referenced websites been verified active?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) All URLs verified active
- [ ] B) Some URLs need verification
- [ ] C) Use organization names without specific URLs where possible
- [ ] D) Add archive.org backup links for critical resources

**Editor Comments:**
URLs are notoriously unstable. For a book that will be in print, consider: (1) Minimizing specific URLs in favor of organization names and "search for [organization name]" language, (2) Using only URLs that are highly stable (government resources, major organizations), (3) Creating a companion web page with maintained links that the book references.

**Editor Reasoning:**
A broken URL in a printed book cannot be fixed until the next edition. Design for durability.

## Section B: Claim Verification (Q6-Q10)

### Q6: Statistical Claims Status

**Context:** Round 3 flagged the "80% effectiveness" claim.

**The Question:** Are all statistical claims now properly sourced or qualified?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) All statistics properly sourced or qualified
- [ ] B) Specific claims still need attention: _____________
- [ ] C) Review all percentage claims
- [ ] D) Statistics are appropriately qualified as estimates

**Editor Comments:**
Round 3 identified a critical issue: "Preemptive awareness reduces their effectiveness by 80%" (Chapter 3, line 23). This reads as research-based but had no source. The author was asked whether this was: (1) Published research (cite it), (2) Clinical observation (reframe as such), or (3) Illustrative estimate (soften or remove). Verify this has been resolved. If qualified as clinical observation, the language should be something like "in clinical experience, preemptive awareness significantly reduces their effectiveness" rather than a specific percentage.

**Editor Reasoning:**
Specific percentages imply research. If there's no research, the book loses credibility when a skeptical reader (or hostile reviewer) asks "where does 80% come from?"

### Q7: Winnicott Citation

**Context:** The "False Self" concept needs proper attribution.

**The Question:** Is the Winnicott "False Self" reference properly cited?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Citation added to bibliography
- [ ] B) Need specific source information
- [ ] C) Add footnote with publication details
- [ ] D) General reference is sufficient for trade book

**Editor Comments:**
Round 3 noted: "Psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott called this the 'False Self'" (Chapter 5, line 49) but no specific source was cited. The concept is well-documented in: Winnicott, D. W. (1960). "Ego Distortion in Terms of True and False Self" in *The Maturational Process and the Facilitating Environment*. Verify this or equivalent citation is now in the bibliography.

**Editor Reasoning:**
Academic completeness for well-known psychological concepts strengthens the book's credibility, especially with professional readers.

**Author Response:**

### Q8: Quote Attributions

**Context:** Round 3 fixed the Gloria Steinem attribution.

**The Question:** Are all quote attributions now accurate and consistent?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) All attributions verified
- [ ] B) Specific quotes need verification: _____________
- [ ] C) "Commonly attributed to" language used where appropriate
- [ ] D) Attributions are accurate

**Editor Comments:**
Round 3 fixed "The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off" in Chapter 1 to read "commonly attributed to Gloria Steinem" rather than direct attribution. However, this fix was noted as NOT YET APPLIED in two other locations:
- README.md, line 227
- course/00-curriculum.md, line 181

Verify these locations are now consistent with the Chapter 1 fix.

**Editor Reasoning:**
Inconsistent attribution across the manuscript looks sloppy. All instances of the same quote should have identical attribution.

### Q9: Neuroscience Claims Currency

**Context:** Neuroscience evolves rapidly.

**The Question:** Do any neuroscience claims need updating?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) All neuroscience claims current and verified
- [ ] B) Specific claims need review: _____________
- [ ] C) Add general disclaimer about evolving research
- [ ] D) No changes needed

**Editor Comments:**
Round 3 verified the following neuroscience claims remain accurate:
- Polyvagal Theory and neuroception (Porges) — *Note: Some aspects of Polyvagal Theory remain contested in academic literature; the book appropriately notes this*
- Intermittent reinforcement and dopamine — Verified
- Trauma bond neurochemistry (dopamine, oxytocin, cortisol, adrenaline) — Verified
- Extended exhale and parasympathetic activation — Verified
- Body processing information faster than conscious mind — Verified

For Round 4, confirm no major updates or retractions have occurred in the underlying research.

**Editor Reasoning:**
The neuroscience grounding is a major strength of the book. Maintaining accuracy protects this strength.

### Q10: Timeline Claims

**Context:** Recovery timelines are sensitive claims.

**The Question:** Are timeline-related claims appropriately qualified?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Timeline claims properly qualified
- [ ] B) Need more "varies by individual" language
- [ ] C) Specific timeline claims to review: _____________
- [ ] D) Qualifications are appropriate

**Editor Comments:**
Round 3 noted the 72-hour timeline for decision-making is "now properly framed as practical guideline, not scientific fact." Verify this framing is consistent. Other timeline claims to check: recovery duration estimates, neurochemistry clearing timeframes, and any "X weeks/months to Y" language. All should be qualified as guidelines with individual variation acknowledged.

**Editor Reasoning:**
Survivors already judge themselves harshly. Timeline claims that suggest "you should be over this by now" cause harm even if unintentional.

## Section C: Technical Accuracy (Q11-Q15)

### Q11: DSM-5 Alignment

**Context:** NPD criteria should be accurately represented.

**The Question:** Is DSM-5 language used accurately?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) DSM-5 references accurate
- [ ] B) Need clarification on specific terms: _____________
- [ ] C) Add explicit "this book does not diagnose" disclaimer
- [ ] D) No changes needed

**Editor Comments:**
Round 3 verified NPD diagnostic criteria are DSM-5 accurate. The book appropriately emphasizes pattern recognition over diagnosis. Verify: (1) No language suggests readers can diagnose others, (2) The distinction between "narcissistic traits" and "Narcissistic Personality Disorder" remains clear, (3) Any DSM-5 criteria quoted or paraphrased are accurate to current edition.

**Editor Reasoning:**
The book walks a line between empowering readers to recognize patterns and preventing armchair diagnosis. Technical accuracy helps maintain this balance.

### Q12: Psychological Terminology

**Context:** Terms must be used accurately.

**The Question:** Is psychological terminology consistently accurate?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Terminology is accurate and consistent
- [ ] B) Specific terms need review: _____________
- [ ] C) Glossary definitions are accurate
- [ ] D) No changes needed

**Editor Comments:**
Round 3 specifically verified that "cognitive dissonance" is now properly distinguished from "trauma bonding" (a common conflation). Other terms to verify for consistent, accurate usage: gaslighting, DARVO, gray rock, intermittent reinforcement, fawning, neuroception, hypervigilance. Each should be defined accurately on first use and used consistently thereafter.

**Editor Reasoning:**
Psychological terms have specific meanings. Using them loosely undermines the book's authority with informed readers.

### Q13: Legal Information Disclaimers

**Context:** Legal-adjacent content needs appropriate qualification.

**The Question:** Is legal-related information properly disclaimed?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Legal information properly qualified with "consult attorney"
- [ ] B) Need stronger disclaimers in specific sections
- [ ] C) Remove specific legal advice
- [ ] D) Current qualifications are appropriate

**Editor Comments:**
The book touches on legal topics: restraining orders, custody battles, documentation strategies, exit planning. None of this should constitute legal advice. Verify: (1) Appropriate "consult with an attorney" language appears where needed, (2) No content could be construed as specific legal guidance, (3) The book acknowledges legal processes vary by jurisdiction.

**Editor Reasoning:**
Legal misinformation can put survivors in danger. The book should empower without overstepping into legal territory.

### Q14: Author Credentials

**Context:** Author authority supports content credibility.

**The Question:** Is author credentialing accurate and appropriate?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Credentialing is accurate
- [ ] B) Need to verify specific credentials
- [ ] C) Add scope of expertise clarification
- [ ] D) Current presentation is appropriate

**Editor Comments:**
Round 3 raised a question: "Donald Winnicott is referred to as a 'psychoanalyst' in Chapter 5. While accurate, he was technically a pediatrician and psychiatrist who became a psychoanalyst." This level of precision matters for academic credibility. Verify that all professional designations (psychoanalyst, psychologist, psychiatrist, therapist, etc.) are used accurately for cited experts.

**Editor Reasoning:**
Accurate credentialing of sources models the precision readers should expect from the book.

### Q15: Overall Factual Assessment

**The Question:** Overall factual accuracy rating for Round 4?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Excellent — no significant concerns
- [ ] B) Good — minor items to address
- [ ] C) Adequate — some items need attention
- [ ] D) Needs work — specific concerns: _____________

**Editor Comments:**
Round 3 concluded: "Overall Factual Accuracy Rating: STRONG. The manuscript maintains the high factual accuracy established in Rounds 1 and 2." The remaining issues were primarily consistency fixes (Gloria Steinem quote in 2 locations) and the 80% effectiveness claim. If these have been addressed, Round 4 should confirm publication readiness from a factual accuracy standpoint.

**Editor Reasoning:**
Factual accuracy is foundational. A book that gets the facts wrong loses trust, regardless of how well-written or compassionate it is.
