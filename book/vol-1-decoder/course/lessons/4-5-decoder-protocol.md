### Script

You have the 52 Decoder Cards. Now let's talk about how to use them in real-time.

The Decoder Protocol is a step-by-step process for moving from confusion to clarity to response—in the moment, when you need it most.

**The challenge**

Here's the problem: Manipulation is designed to activate you.

When you're activated—flooded, confused, anxious—your prefrontal cortex goes offline. The part of your brain that holds the decoder cards becomes inaccessible.

This is why you recognize manipulation an hour later instead of in the moment. Your thinking brain wasn't available.

The Decoder Protocol is designed to work even when you're activated. It gives you a sequence that doesn't require complex thinking.

**The Four Steps**

**STEP 1: NOTICE**

Something feels off. Your body is telling you something.

You might notice:
- Tightening in your chest or stomach
- Confusion or fog in your thinking
- Urge to defend, explain, or apologize
- Feeling suddenly smaller or wrong
- The conversation feeling somehow "off"

This is your signal. Something is happening.

At this point, you don't need to know what. You just need to notice that something is.

**STEP 2: PAUSE**

This is the 3-3-3 Rule in action.

3 seconds. Count silently if needed.
3 breaths. Inhale 4, exhale 6.
Don't respond yet.

The pause does two things: It interrupts the reaction pattern they're counting on, and it gives your thinking brain a moment to come back online.

If you can't think of what to do, the pause itself is doing something. You're not feeding the manipulation.

**STEP 3: DECODE**

Now ask: Which card is this? What does it mean?

Scan through the categories:
- Is this about my perception? (Gaslight, Shift, Deny)
- Is this emotional hijacking? (Guilt, Shame, Bomb)
- Is this relational manipulation? (Triangle, Freeze, Intermittent)
- Is this punishment? (Threat, Wall, Scorecard)
- Is this identity attack? (Comparison, Minimizer)

Name the pattern and recall what it means:
- "This is the Flip—they're making themselves the victim to avoid accountability."
- "This is the Goalpost—the target is moving so I can never succeed."
- "This is the Guilt Hook—they're invoking debt I don't actually owe."

You might not get it exactly right. That's okay. Any recognition is better than confusion.

Name it, even silently. Naming breaks the spell.

**STEP 4: RESPOND**

Now you have options:

**Option A: Use the card's response.**
Each card has suggested responses. Use them verbatim if helpful:
"My reaction is information about my experience."
"I trust my memory."
"What do YOU think?"

**Option B: Use a neutral response.**
Buy more time:
"I'll think about that."
"I need a moment."
"Let me get back to you."

**Option C: Disengage.**
If the situation allows:
"I'm going to step away."
"We can discuss this later."
"I'm done with this conversation for now."

The goal is not to win. The goal is to stay clear and protect yourself.

**The Protocol in Practice**

Let me walk through an example.

Situation: Your partner just said, "After everything I've done for you, you're still not happy. My ex was right—you're impossible to please."

**Step 1: Notice.**
Your stomach drops. You feel the urge to defend yourself, to prove you're not ungrateful.

**Step 2: Pause.**
One, two, three. Breath in. Breath out. Don't respond yet.

**Step 3: Decode.**
What card is this? What does it mean? Multiple patterns present:
- The Guilt Hook ("After everything I've done")—weaponizing my conscience
- The Comparison ("My ex was right")—making me compete with an invisible standard
- The Scorecard (Bringing up the past)—using history as ammunition

My job is to not defend, not compete, not accept the guilt frame.

**Step 4: Respond.**
"I appreciate what you've done. That's separate from what we're discussing now."
Or: "I'm not going to discuss your ex."
Or: "I'll think about what you said. I need to step away."

You've moved from confusion to clarity to response—in real-time.

**Building protocol speed**

This takes practice. At first, the four steps might take minutes. Eventually, they happen in seconds.

How to build speed:

**Rehearse mentally.** Visualize scenarios. Walk through the protocol. Do it when you're calm so it's available when you're not.

**Practice with low-stakes situations.** Use the protocol for minor manipulations. Build the habit before you need it for major ones.

**Review after events.** When something confusing happens, walk through the protocol afterward. "What did I notice? What card was it? What could I have said?"

**Use physical anchors.** Some people touch thumb to finger as a reminder to pause. Some take a sip of water. Find an anchor that prompts the protocol.

**When the protocol fails**

Sometimes you won't catch it in time. Sometimes you'll be too activated to think. Sometimes you'll react before you can pause.

That's okay.

The protocol is a practice, not a test. Every time you use it—even partially—you're building the skill.

And you can always return to the interaction later with clarity. "I've been thinking about what you said. I want to address it differently."

You don't have to win in the moment. You just have to stay clear over time.

**Module 4 Complete**

You now have your decoder toolkit:
- 28 Core Cards for daily patterns
- 24 Advanced Cards for sophisticated tactics
- The 4-step Decoder Protocol for real-time use

In Module 5, we'll focus on response and recovery—rewiring your nervous system, practical scripts, and moving forward.

## Exercise

**Protocol Practice**

**Part 1: Mental Rehearsal**

Choose 3 recent confusing interactions. For each, walk through the protocol:

| Step | Interaction 1 | Interaction 2 | Interaction 3 |
|------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| NOTICE: What did I feel? | | | |
| PAUSE: Did I pause? Could I have? | | | |
| DECODE: Which card(s)? What did they mean? | | | |
| RESPOND: What could I have said? | | | |

**Part 2: Scenario Preparation**

For a likely upcoming interaction with a manipulative person:
1. What patterns are most likely to appear?
2. What cards should I have ready?
3. What's my planned response for each?
4. What's my exit strategy if needed?

**Part 3: Anchor Creation**

Choose a physical anchor to remind you of the protocol:
- What will it be? (Touch, breath, phrase, object)
- When will you use it?
- Practice it 10 times today.
