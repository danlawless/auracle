## 📖 Reading Paths

Choose your path based on where you are:

### 🆘 If You're in Crisis
1. **[Chapter 14: Energetic Remapping](./chapters/14-energetic-remapping.md)** — Immediate grounding tools
2. **[Chapter 15: Practical Responses](./chapters/15-practical-responses.md)** — Scripts you can use right now
3. **Emergency Resources:**
   - National Domestic Violence Hotline: **1-800-799-7233** (24/7)
   - Crisis Text Line: Text **HOME** to **741741**
   - National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: **988**

### 🔍 If You're Trying to Understand
Read the book in order starting from the [Front Matter](./00-front-matter.md). The chapters build on each other, taking you from recognition through understanding to response.

### 💔 If You're Healing
1. **[Chapter 4: Trauma Bonds](./chapters/04-trauma-bonds.md)** — Understand the biology of what happened
2. **[Volume 2: The Bridge](../vol-2-bridge/README.md)** — Continue your healing journey with attachment repair

### 🎯 If You Need to Confirm What You're Seeing
**[Chapter 17: The Exposure Questions](./chapters/17-exposure-questions.md)** — Questions designed to reveal narcissistic patterns. Healthy people answer these easily; narcissists cannot.

### 🤝 If You're Helping Others
The **Decoder Cards** in Chapters [11](./chapters/11-decoder-cards-core.md), [12](./chapters/12-decoder-cards-advanced.md), and [13](./chapters/13-decoder-cards-protocol.md) are designed to be shared—use them as conversation starters or teaching tools.

### 🎬 If You're Creating Content
When you're ready to share what you've learned, **[Appendix D: Content Creation Structure](../vol-2-bridge/appendices/appendix-d-content-creation.md)** in Volume 2 provides a framework for turning this material into videos, posts, and educational content—including a readiness self-assessment to ensure you're speaking from healing, not from the wound.

## 🎯 The Core Tools

### The 3-3-3 Rule
Memorize this framework for responding in the moment:

- **3 Seconds:** Pause before responding. Count silently.
- **3 Breaths:** Inhale 4, exhale 6. Engage your parasympathetic nervous system.
- **3 Words (or fewer):** "I'll think about that." "Interesting perspective." "Not for me."

### The 72-Hour Test
Before making any major decision about someone, wait 72 hours:
- Love-bombing neurochemistry needs time to settle
- Patterns invisible in excitement become visible in calm
- Trust the version of yourself that emerges after the intensity fades

### The Master Question
If you could only ask one question to expose a narcissist:

> *"When was the last time you were genuinely wrong, admitted it without being forced to, and changed your behavior as a result?"*

Healthy people produce a specific, recent example with genuine reflection. Narcissists struggle, deflect, reverse, or produce an example where they were actually right all along.

## 💬 A Note Before You Begin

> *Take a breath.*
>
> *What you're about to read may activate memories, emotions, and realizations. That's normal. That's part of the process. Your nervous system stored these experiences for a reason—it was trying to protect you.*
>
> *Now, you're choosing to look directly at what happened. That takes courage.*
>
> *Go slowly. Put the book down when you need to. Come back when you're ready.*
>
> *This is not a race. This is a homecoming.*
