## 💬 A Note Before You Begin

> *You've done the inner work.*
>
> *You can name the patterns. You've healed the nervous system. You've installed sovereignty. You've begun to inhabit your presence.*
>
> *But something is still missing.*
>
> *Maybe it's the career you lost to the relationship. Maybe it's the savings that were drained. Maybe it's the scarcity that still lives in your body, even when the bank account says otherwise.*
>
> *This book is about the return.*
>
> *Not returning to who you were before—that person is gone. But returning to the world with your whole self. Building a life that matches the healing you've done.*
>
> *You are allowed to thrive. Not just survive.*

## 🌉 The Core Principle

**Your prosperity is not a betrayal of your healing. It is a fruit of it.**

You survived. You healed. Now you are allowed to thrive.

Thriving is not selfish. It is not a betrayal of those still struggling. It is the natural outcome of the work you've done—and permission to let your outer life match your inner transformation.

---

## 📘 Before This Book

This book assumes you have:
- Named the patterns → **[Volume 1: The Narcissism Decoder](../vol-1-decoder/README.md)**
- Begun healing → **[Volume 2: The Bridge](../vol-2-bridge/README.md)**
- Installed sovereignty → **[Volume 3: Sovereignty](../vol-3-sovereignty/README.md)**

This volume can be read alongside or after Volume 4 (embodiment). It addresses a parallel track: while Volume 4 covers embodied presence, this covers embodied prosperity.
