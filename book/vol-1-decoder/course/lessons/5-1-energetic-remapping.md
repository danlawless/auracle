### Script

Welcome to Module 5: Response and Recovery.

You've done the hard work of recognition. You know the tactics. You have the decoder cards. You understand the systems.

Now we move to healing.

This lesson focuses on your nervous system—the part of you that holds the patterns in your body. Understanding tactics is cognitive. Recovery is somatic. We need both.

**What is energetic remapping?**

Your nervous system has been trained by manipulation.

It learned to track the manipulator's mood. It learned to anticipate danger. It learned to scan for threats, to tense before conflict, to stay hypervigilant.

These patterns are stored in your body, not just your mind. That's why you can understand something intellectually and still react the old way physically.

Energetic remapping is the process of retraining your nervous system—teaching it that you are safe now, that the threat level has changed, that new responses are possible.

**The window of tolerance**

Your nervous system has a "window of tolerance"—a range where you can think clearly, respond wisely, and regulate your emotions.

Above the window: hyperactivation. Anxiety, panic, racing thoughts, anger. Too much arousal.

Below the window: hypoactivation. Numbness, dissociation, collapse, shutdown. Too little arousal.

Inside the window: regulation. Presence, clarity, choice.

Manipulation repeatedly pushed you outside your window. You got used to living in hyperactivation (constantly anxious, hypervigilant) or hypoactivation (checked out, numb, frozen).

Recovery means expanding your window and learning to return to it when pushed out.

**Practice 1: Grounding**

Let's start with a basic grounding practice. This brings you back to the present moment when you're activated.

Find your feet on the floor. Feel the contact.

Notice the weight of your body in the chair. Let gravity hold you.

Now engage your senses:
- Name 5 things you can see
- Name 4 things you can hear
- Name 3 things you can feel (physical sensations)
- Name 2 things you can smell
- Name 1 thing you can taste

Take a breath. You are here. You are now. You are safe in this moment.

This practice works because trauma lives in timelessness. When you're activated, your body doesn't know the threat is in the past. Grounding brings you to the present, where the threat doesn't exist.

**Practice 2: The containment breath**

This is a breathing practice for calming intense emotions.

Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly.

Breathe in for 4 counts—feel your belly expand.
Hold for 4 counts.
Breathe out for 8 counts—twice as long as the inhale.
Hold for 4 counts.

Repeat 4 times.

The extended exhale activates your parasympathetic nervous system—the calming system. The hold after exhale allows the calm to settle.

Use this when you're above your window—anxious, activated, racing.

**Practice 3: Body shake**

When energy is trapped—when you feel the charge but can't discharge it—try shaking.

Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.
Bend your knees slightly.
Begin shaking from your legs, letting it move up through your body.
Let your arms shake. Let your shoulders shake.
Make sound if you want—sighs, growls, whatever wants to come.
Continue for 2-3 minutes.
Then stand still and feel the buzzing sensation in your body.

This is what animals do after a threat—they shake and discharge the survival energy. Humans are often taught to suppress this. The energy gets stuck.

Shaking releases stored activation.

**Practice 4: Orienting**

This practice helps with hypervigilance—the chronic scanning for threat.

Sit comfortably. Let your eyes wander the room.

Slowly—really slowly—turn your head from side to side.

Let your eyes find things that are neutral or pleasant.

Really look at each object. Notice colors, shapes, textures.

Allow your nervous system to register: "There is no threat here."

Continue for 2-3 minutes.

This practice sends the message to your nervous system that the environment is safe. It counteracts the hypervigilance that learned to scan for danger constantly.

**Practice 5: Self-holding**

Sometimes we need to provide the containment that was never given to us.

Cross your arms and hold your upper arms—giving yourself a hug.

Or place one hand on your heart and one on your belly.

Breathe slowly.

Say to yourself: "I am here. I am safe. I am enough."

This practice provides the co-regulation we needed and didn't receive. Over time, it teaches the nervous system that safety is available from within.

**Building a daily practice**

Nervous system retraining happens through repetition, not intensity.

Five minutes of practice daily is more effective than an hour once a week.

Here's a simple daily sequence:

**Morning (2 minutes):**
- Orienting: Slow scan of your room
- Self-holding with intention for the day

**Midday check-in (1 minute):**
- 5-4-3-2-1 grounding
- One containment breath

**Evening (2 minutes):**
- Body shake to discharge the day
- Self-holding with gratitude

**As needed:**
- Containment breath when activated
- Grounding when dissociating
- Shake when energy is stuck

**After difficult interactions**

Here's a protocol for after you've been exposed to manipulation:

1. **Remove yourself** from the situation as soon as possible.

2. **Ground** immediately. 5-4-3-2-1. Feet on floor.

3. **Shake** if possible. Discharge the activation.

4. **Containment breath.** 4-4-8-4. Several rounds.

5. **Orient.** Slow look around. Register safety.

6. **Self-holding.** Remind yourself: you're okay. That was then. This is now.

7. **Journal** if helpful. Use the decoder protocol to process what happened.

**The goal is not to be unaffected**

I want to be clear about something.

The goal of nervous system work is not to become unaffected by manipulation. It's not to feel nothing.

The goal is to return to regulation faster. To not get stuck in activation for hours or days. To have choice about your response.

You will still feel things. You should feel things. Feelings are information.

But you won't be ruled by those feelings. You'll be able to work with them rather than being controlled by them.

**In our next lesson,** we'll cover practical responses—what to actually say when you're facing manipulation.

For now, practice these techniques. Your nervous system learned its patterns over years. Retraining takes time and patience.

But it works. And you deserve a nervous system that knows it's safe.
