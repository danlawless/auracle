### Script

Now that you understand the biology of attachment, let's look at the specific cycle that creates trauma bonds.

Understanding this cycle will help you answer the question you've probably asked yourself a hundred times: "Why didn't I just leave?"

**What is a trauma bond?**

A trauma bond is an attachment that forms through cycles of abuse and intermittent reinforcement.

The term was coined by Patrick J. Carnes, Ph.D., describing how "the misuse of fear, excitement, and sexual physiology" entangles another person. Unlike healthy attachments—which develop through consistent care—trauma bonds develop through inconsistency itself.

**The four-phase cycle**

This model builds on Lenore Walker's research on abusive relationships from 1979, with the reconciliation phase later clarified as distinct from the calm period.

**Phase 1: Tension Building**
You can feel something shifting. They're becoming irritable, distant, critical. You start walking on eggshells. You try to manage their mood. You might blame yourself for the building tension.

**Phase 2: Incident**
The tension releases through some form of abuse—rage, punishment, emotional attack, manipulation. This is the "bad" that you can clearly identify.

**Phase 3: Reconciliation**
They apologize. They become the person you fell in love with. They explain, minimize, or promise change. Sometimes they blame external factors. Sometimes they blame you, but gently. This is the "good" that keeps you hoping.

**Phase 4: Calm (Honeymoon)**
Things return to stability. Maybe even better than normal. You feel relieved. You believe things have changed. This is where hope lives.

Then tension begins building again.

**Why the cycle creates attachment**

Remember what we learned about intermittent reinforcement: unpredictable reward creates the strongest bonds.

In this cycle, the "reward" is the reconciliation phase. After the pain of the incident, the relief and love of reconciliation floods your brain with dopamine.

That flood creates attachment—not despite the abuse, but because of it.

**The relief high**

Here's something counterintuitive: The worse the incident phase, the more intense the relief of reconciliation.

When you've been hurt, scared, diminished—and then suddenly they're kind again—your nervous system experiences profound relief. The contrast creates the high.

People outside the relationship can't understand this. They say "Just leave." But they don't understand that leaving feels like giving up what feels like the most intense love you've ever experienced.

**The addiction pattern**

Trauma bonds share key features with addiction:

**Tolerance**: Over time, you need more intensity to feel the same relief. The "good" phases need to be better and better to compensate for the worsening "bad."

**Withdrawal**: When you try to leave, you experience symptoms similar to drug withdrawal—anxiety, depression, physical discomfort, obsessive thoughts about returning.

**Craving**: Even when you know the relationship is harmful, you crave contact. You might break no-contact just to hear their voice.

**Loss of control**: You make commitments to yourself—to leave, to set boundaries, to not respond—and you find yourself breaking them.

**Continued use despite consequences**: You stay or return despite clear evidence of harm.

This isn't weakness. This is how trauma bonds work.

**Breaking the bond**

If understanding alone doesn't break trauma bonds, what does?

**Time and complete separation.** The neurochemistry needs time to reset. Every contact—even checking their social media—triggers the cycle. Weeks or months of no contact allows the addiction pattern to weaken.

**Replacement connections.** Your attachment system needs somewhere to go. Supportive friends, family, therapists, support groups—these provide alternative attachment that doesn't require you to return.

**Nervous system work.** The body holds the bond. Somatic practices, therapy, physical exercise—these help discharge the activation stored in your body.

**Repeated understanding.** Reading, listening, reviewing why this is a trauma bond not love—this eventually allows the cognitive understanding to influence the limbic response.

**Grief.** You have to grieve what you thought the relationship was. The person you loved—the one from the idealization phase—is gone (or never existed). That loss is real and needs to be mourned.

We'll explore these approaches in later modules. For now, hold this:

The bond is not evidence of love.
The bond is not evidence of connection.
The bond is a neurological pattern that developed through manipulation.

It can be broken. It takes time. It takes support. But it can be broken.

**Before our next lesson**

Take a moment to acknowledge what you've just learned.

If you've been in a trauma bond, you've been experiencing a neurological addiction to someone who was hurting you. The confusion, the going back, the difficulty leaving—none of that was your fault.

It was the nature of the bond.

In our next lesson, we'll look at how these dynamics play out in family systems—where many of us first learned these patterns.

## Exercise

**Trauma Bond Assessment**

Reflect on a relationship where you struggled to leave or kept returning:

**The Cycle:**
1. Can you identify the tension-building phase? What did it feel like?
2. What forms did the "incident" phase take?
3. What happened during reconciliation? What did they say or do?
4. How long did calm phases last?

**The Addiction Signs:**
| Sign | Present? | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Tolerance (needing more intensity) | Y/N | |
| Withdrawal symptoms when apart | Y/N | |
| Craving contact | Y/N | |
| Breaking commitments to self | Y/N | |
| Continuing despite clear harm | Y/N | |

**The Relief High:**
- Can you remember the relief after reconciliation?
- Did it feel like intense love?
- How does understanding that as neurochemistry change your perspective?

## Key Concepts

- Trauma bonds form through cycles of abuse and intermittent reinforcement
- The four phases: tension, incident, reconciliation, calm
- The relief after abuse creates attachment because of it, not despite it
- Trauma bonds share features with addiction
- Breaking the bond requires time, no contact, alternative connections, and grief
- The bond is not evidence of love—it's a neurological pattern

- Tone: Deeply validating, educational, compassionate
- Pace: Slower; this is heavy material
- Energy: Gentle but clear
- Note: "The bond is not evidence of love" needs to land with care and repetition
