## Key Terms for Embodied Leadership

---

## A

**Absorption**
Taking on another person's emotional or energetic state as if it were your own. Distinguished from empathy (feeling with) and enmeshment (fusing with).

**Aura**
The energetic field surrounding the body. Not mystical—the detectable electromagnetic and bioelectric field generated by all living beings.

**Aura Hygiene**
The practice of maintaining clarity and coherence in one's personal field through daily, weekly, and monthly clearing practices.

---

## C

**Chemistry**
The felt sense of nervous system activation in the presence of another person. Often confused with compatibility. Chemistry can signal danger recognition as easily as safe attraction.

**Clean Desire**
Wanting that arises from genuine preference rather than anxiety, survival need, or attachment wound. Characterized by spaciousness rather than urgency.

**Clean Intimacy**
Sexual and emotional closeness that emerges from presence and choice rather than performance, obligation, or survival need.

**Coherence**
A state where heart, brain, and nervous system are synchronized. Associated with clarity, presence, and regulated engagement.

**Consent Ladder**
A four-state framework (Yes, Maybe, No, Later) for tracking internal signals during intimacy and decision-making.

**Cord**
An energetic connection between two people. Healthy cords are appropriate to relationship; unhealthy cords are entangled, draining, or disproportionate.

**Contempt**
Different from dominance or insecurity—contempt requires dismissal of another's humanity. The belief that someone is beneath consideration. A relationship ender.

**Co-regulation**
The process by which one person's regulated nervous system helps another regulate. Foundational to secure attachment and healthy intimacy.

## D

**Dominance vs. Contempt vs. Insecurity**
Three patterns that can look similar but have different roots. Dominance: someone needs to lead. Insecurity: fear disguised as control. Contempt: dismissal of humanity. Only contempt is inherently destructive.

**Desire Archaeology**
A practice for identifying the origins of sexual and relational patterns by examining significant relationships and their nervous system contexts.

**Detachment That Loves**
The capacity to remain connected without entanglement. Caring without carrying. Love without absorption.

**Differentiation**
Maintaining individual identity and boundaries while remaining emotionally connected. The opposite of enmeshment.

**Dissociation**
A protective nervous system response characterized by disconnection from body, emotions, or present experience. Common during trauma and often unconscious during intimacy.

---

## E

**Embodied Leadership**
Leadership that emerges from regulated presence rather than performance, strategy, or dominance. The integration of sovereignty into action.

**Enmeshment**
A relationship pattern where boundaries dissolve and identities blur. Often mistaken for intimacy or closeness.

**Erotic Boundaries**
Internal body-based signals that indicate consent, desire, and choice during intimacy. Not rules but sensations to honor.

**Erotic Sovereignty**
Ownership of one's sexual energy and expression. The capacity to choose from desire rather than survival.

---

## F

**Fast Burn**
A relationship pattern characterized by rapid intensity and nervous system activation. Often feels like chemistry but functions like addiction.

**Field**
The energetic atmosphere created by a person's presence. Includes but is not limited to the aura. Extends into the space one occupies.

**Field Hygiene**
See Aura Hygiene.

---

## G

**Grounding**
The practice of returning attention to the physical body and present moment, especially through feet, breath, and sensation.

---

## I

**Identity Mirroring (Me Too Pattern)**
Responding to others' experiences with "me too" to regulate rather than connect. Flattens difference, prevents curiosity, and creates pseudo-empathy.

**Insight as Control**
The shadow side of wisdom—using psychological framework or spiritual insight to dominate, manipulate, or avoid accountability.

**Intergenerational Pattern**
Relational, emotional, or behavioral patterns transmitted across generations through modeling, environment, and epigenetic inheritance.

---

## L

**Life Force**
The vital creative energy within all beings. Sexual energy is one expression of life force, not its totality.

---

## M

**Magnetism**
The natural attractive quality that emerges from regulated presence and coherence. Distinguished from manipulation, which manufactures attraction.

---

## N

**Neutral Presence**
The capacity to witness without reacting, absorbing, or fixing. Spacious attention that doesn't require action.

**Neuroception**
The nervous system's unconscious assessment of safety or threat. Happens faster than conscious thought.

---

## O

**Override**
The habitual pattern of ignoring body signals to maintain connection, avoid conflict, or meet external expectations.

---

## P

**Polarity**
The dynamic tension between different energetic qualities (masculine/feminine, active/receptive). Can exist between two people or within one person.

**Presence**
The state of being fully here—embodied, attentive, and available to the present moment without performing or managing.

---

## R

**Recognition**
The nervous system experience of "knowing" someone because they match a familiar pattern, often from childhood. Can be mistaken for connection or attraction.

**Regulation**
The capacity to return the nervous system to a calm, present state after activation.

**Return to Sender**
A practice for releasing absorbed energy that isn't yours, returning it with compassion rather than rejection.

---

## S

**Shadow**
The unconscious aspects of self—particularly those that contradict the self-image. In leadership, the shadow often involves unacknowledged need for status, control, or specialness.

**Slow Burn**
A relationship pattern characterized by gradual bonding and nervous system regulation. Often feels less exciting than fast burn but builds sustainable connection.

**Sovereignty**
Living from internal authority. Making choices from one's own center without requiring external validation.

**Spiritual Hierarchy**
The shadow pattern of using spiritual development or insight to establish rank or superiority over others.

**Spiritual Language as Social Power**
Using spiritual terminology strategically—for deflection, false elevation, boundary bypass, or authority claims. When spiritual language shuts down conversation rather than opening it.

---

## V

**Vagal Reset**
A practice using breath, orientation, and grounding to shift from sympathetic activation to ventral vagal (safe/social) state.

**Ventral Vagal**
The nervous system state associated with safety, social engagement, and presence. The target state for regulated intimacy and leadership.

---

## W

**Window of Tolerance**
The range of arousal within which a person can function effectively. Outside this window, one moves into hyperarousal or hypoarousal.
