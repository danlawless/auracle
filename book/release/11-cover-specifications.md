## Design Recommendations

### Color Palette (Series Consistency)

Each volume should have its own identity while maintaining series cohesion through consistent accent colors and typography.

**Volume 1: The Narcissism Decoder** — Recognition

Consider darker, more intense tones that suggest "decoding" and revelation:

- Primary: Deep charcoal or black (#1a1a1a)
- Accent: Gold or amber (#d4a857) — suggests illumination, truth revealed
- Text: White or cream for contrast
- Mood: Dark to light, breaking through confusion

**Volume 2: The Bridge** — Liberation

Consider warmer, softer tones that suggest healing and transition:

- Primary: Deep teal or forest green (#2d4a43) — suggests growth, calm
- Accent: Warm gold or soft copper (#c5a47e) — continuity with Vol 1
- Text: Cream or warm white
- Mood: Crossing over, movement, hope

**Volume 3: Sovereignty** — Empowerment

Consider grounded, authoritative tones that suggest standing firm:

- Primary: Deep navy or midnight blue (#1a2a3a) — suggests depth, stability
- Accent: Silver or platinum (#c0c0c0) — suggests clarity, self-trust
- Secondary Accent: Warm gold (#d4a857) — series continuity
- Text: White or silver
- Mood: Stillness, authority, groundedness

**Volume 4: Embodied Leadership** — Embodiment

Consider radiant, coherent tones that suggest presence and integration:

- Primary: Deep plum or burgundy (#4a1a3a) — suggests depth, embodiment
- Accent: Rose gold (#b76e79) — suggests warmth, life force
- Secondary Accent: Gold (#d4a857) — series continuity
- Text: Cream or rose gold
- Mood: Radiance, coherence, full expression

**Series Cohesion:**
- Use the same font family across all four covers
- Keep gold accent color consistent (appears on all volumes)
- Similar layout structure (title position, author name placement)
- "The Sovereignty Series" subtitle on each (optional)
- Consider numbering: "Volume 1" etc. in small text

---

### Typography Recommendations

**Title Fonts (choose one style):**

*Serif (Classic, authoritative):*
- Playfair Display
- Cormorant Garamond
- Libre Baskerville

*Sans-Serif (Modern, clean):*
- Montserrat
- Raleway
- Josefin Sans

*Display (Distinctive, memorable):*
- Cinzel (elegant, structured)
- Yeseva One (bold, impactful)

**Subtitle/Author Name:**
- Use a complementary font (if title is serif, subtitle can be sans-serif)
- Keep author name smaller but clearly legible
- Consider all caps for author name

**Size Hierarchy:**
1. Title (largest)
2. Subtitle (medium)
3. Author name (smallest but readable)
