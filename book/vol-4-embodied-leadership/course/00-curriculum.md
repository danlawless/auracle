## Course Modules

### Module 1: The Energy Field
**Lessons:** 4 | **Duration:** ~1.5 hours

Understanding and working with your aura.

| Lesson | Title | Duration |
|--------|-------|----------|

| 1.4 | Daily Energy Practice | 20 min |

**Key Scripts:**

**Lesson 1.2: Aura Hygiene**
> Your energy field extends beyond your physical body. It's constantly interacting with other fields—absorbing, exchanging, entangling. Without conscious hygiene, you carry residue from every interaction. Aura hygiene isn't esoteric—it's practical. Clearing your field, checking for cord attachments, grounding excess energy. Think of it like showering, but for your energetic body.

### Module 3: Erotic Coherence

**Key Scripts:**

**Lesson 3.1: Sexual Energy as Life Force**
> Erotic energy is not just about sex. It's life force—the creative pulse that drives all manifestation. When it flows freely, you feel alive, magnetic, creative. When it's blocked, leaked, or stolen, you feel depleted, invisible, stuck. Coherence means your erotic energy is yours—not performing for approval, not dissipated through unconscious expression, not weaponized for control. It simply belongs to you.

**Key Scripts:**

**Lesson 5.1: Shadow of the Healer**
> Those of us drawn to healing often carry a shadow: the need to be needed. We may unconsciously create dependency in those we help. We may derive our worth from others' wounds. The shadow of the healer is that helping can become another form of control. True embodied leadership means helping without needing to help. Holding space without filling it with yourself.
