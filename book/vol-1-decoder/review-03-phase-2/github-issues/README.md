## Why These Run in Parallel

Unlike Phase 1 (where structural decisions affected everything), Phase 2 reviewers address independent concerns:
- **Bailey** asks: "Does this engage and serve readers?"
- **Sage** asks: "Does this represent diverse communities respectfully?"
- **Felix** asks: "Is this accurate and properly sourced?"

Changes from one reviewer don't invalidate another's work.
