**CARD 11: THE BOMB**

**What they say:**
(In the beginning): "You're the most amazing person I've ever met."
"I've never felt this way before."
"We're soulmates."
"I want to spend every moment with you."

**What they mean:**
"I'm overwhelming you with intensity to create fast attachment before you can assess me."

**The function:**
Creates neurochemical bonding that overrides evaluation. Speed replaces discernment.

**Your response:**
"I prefer to let things develop naturally."
Slow down. Don't match their pace. Watch behavior over time.

---

**CARD 12: THE DRAIN**

**What they say:**
"I need you."
"You're the only one who understands."
"I can't cope without you."
"You have to help me with this."

**What they mean:**
"Your energy exists to serve my needs. Your depletion is acceptable."

**The function:**
Positions you as caretaker. Makes your needs secondary. Creates exhaustion.

**Your response:**
"I care about you AND I have limits."
"This seems like something for a professional."
Give support, not unlimited resources.

---

**CARD 13: THE MARTYR**

**What they say:**
"I do everything around here."
"No one appreciates me."
"I sacrificed everything for this family."
"You don't know how much I do for you."

**What they mean:**
"My suffering entitles me to your compliance. You owe me for my pain."

**The function:**
Creates guilt. Deflects any criticism by positioning themselves as victim.

**Your response:**
"I hear that you're struggling. How can we share the load?"
Validate without accepting blame. Redirect to solutions.

---

**CARD 14: THE TEST**

**What they say:**
"If you really loved me, you would..."
"Prove to me that I can trust you."
"Let me see your phone."
"Cancel your plans—I need you here."

**What they mean:**
"Your compliance equals love. Pass my test or face consequences."

**The function:**
Establishes control through manufactured loyalty demonstrations.

**Your response:**
"I don't need to prove my love through compliance."
"Trust is built through consistency, not tests."
Refuse manufactured hoops.

---

**CARD 15: THE CHAOS**

**What they say:**
(Creates drama, crisis, emergency just as you're about to address something important)
"We can't talk about that now—look what's happening!"
"How can you bring that up when I'm dealing with this?"

**What they mean:**
"I'll create distraction to avoid accountability. The crisis outranks your concern."

**The function:**
Prevents difficult conversations. Commands your attention. Avoids resolution.

**Your response:**
"We can address the crisis AND return to this topic."
Note the pattern. Return to the issue once calm.

---

**CARD 16: THE GOALPOST**

**What they say:**
"You did X, but you should have done Y."
"That's not what I meant—I wanted..."
"You got most of it right, but you forgot..."
"Almost—but next time..."

**What they mean:**
"You can never fully satisfy me. The target will always move."

**The function:**
Keeps you trying indefinitely. Creates perpetual inadequacy.

**Your response:**
"I did what was agreed. If expectations changed, let me know earlier."
Track original requests. Refuse moving targets.

---

**CARD 17: THE DENY**

**What they say:**
"I didn't mean it that way."
"That's not how I intended it."
"You're misunderstanding me."
"I would never do that—you know me."

**What they mean:**
"My intention matters more than my impact. If I didn't mean harm, you shouldn't feel it."

**The function:**
Avoids accountability through claimed good intentions.

**Your response:**
"Whatever your intention, this was the impact."
"Impact matters more than intention."
Stay focused on effect, not explanation.

---

**CARD 18: THE SCORECARD**

**What they say:**
"Remember when YOU did that thing three years ago?"
"You're one to talk—what about when you..."
"Let me remind you of all your failures."
"You've done worse things than this."

**What they mean:**
"I'll use your history against you whenever you challenge me."

**The function:**
Deflects current accountability. Makes you defensive about the past.

**Your response:**
"That's a separate conversation. Right now we're discussing [current issue]."
Stay on topic. Don't defend old ground.

---

**CARD 19: THE WALL**

**What they say:**
"I don't know what you want me to say."
"I can't do anything right anyway."
"Fine. Whatever. You're always right."
(Shutdown. Disengagement. Passive non-presence)

**What they mean:**
"I'll make this so frustrating that you give up. Disengagement is my power."

**The function:**
Prevents resolution by making conversation impossible. Wins through attrition.

**Your response:**
"I'd like to find a resolution. When you're ready to engage, let me know."
Don't push against the wall. Step back. They'll re-engage when they need something.
