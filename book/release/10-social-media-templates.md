## 10 Ready-to-Post Caption Templates

Copy, customize, and post. Each includes hook, content, and CTA.

---

### Post 1: The Core Message

**Hook:** You're not too sensitive.

**Content:**
You're not too sensitive.
You're not overreacting.
You're not making it up.

The confusion you felt? That was the point.
The self-doubt? Engineered.
The feeling that you were both too much and never enough?
That was the trap.

And it was set long before you walked into it.

**CTA:** The patterns have names. Link in bio.

---

### Post 2: The Test

**Hook:** The only test you need.

**Content:**
Genuine care makes you feel more yourself.

Control disguised as care makes you feel less yourself.

That's the only test you need.

**CTA:** More in my new book—link in bio.

---

### Post 3: The Disguises

**Hook:** Control never announces itself.

**Content:**
Control doesn't walk into the room with a sign.

It arrives dressed as:
→ Concern: "I was just checking on you."
→ Love: "I only act this way because I care."
→ Honesty: "Someone needs to tell you the truth."
→ Protection: "I'm trying to keep you safe."
→ Logic: "You're being emotional."

Each sounds reasonable.
That's what makes them so effective.

**CTA:** The full playbook is in my book. Link in bio.

---

### Post 4: The 3-3-3 Rule

**Hook:** When activated, try this.

**Content:**
The 3-3-3 Rule for responding in the moment:

**3 Seconds:** Pause. Count silently. Interrupt the automatic reaction.

**3 Breaths:** Inhale 4, exhale 6. Engage your calm nervous system.

**3 Words (or fewer):** "I'll think about that." "Interesting perspective." "Not for me."

The less you say, the less they have to twist.

**CTA:** Save this. You'll need it.

---

### Post 5: Chemistry vs. Familiarity

**Hook:** What you call chemistry might be trauma recognition.

**Content:**
What we call chemistry is often familiarity.
What we call boredom is often safety.

Your nervous system seeks what it recognizes, not what it needs.

That's why "spark" and "red flag" feel so similar at first.

**CTA:** This is from The Bridge—link in bio.

---

### Post 6: Insight Isn't Enough

**Hook:** You can't think your way into secure attachment.

**Content:**
You understand the patterns.
You can name the tactics.
You see it clearly now.

And yet your body still reacts.

That's not failure. That's the gap between insight and embodiment.

Awareness is not regulation.
You train it.

**CTA:** The Bridge is the training. Link in bio.

---

### Post 7: The Pattern (Carousel idea)

**Hook:** Signs it's control, not care (save this)

**Slide 1:** Signs it's control, not care
**Slide 2:** You feel smaller after conversations
**Slide 3:** You're always explaining yourself
**Slide 4:** They "check in" but it feels like surveillance
**Slide 5:** Their feedback feels like attack, not support
**Slide 6:** You walk on eggshells to keep the peace
**Slide 7:** Naming the pattern breaks its power.

**CTA:** Free Decoder Cards in bio—12 patterns named.

---

### Post 8: For the Helpers

**Hook:** If you grew up as the emotional regulator...

**Content:**
If you grew up as the family's emotional regulator:

You learned to read rooms before you learned to read books.
You managed moods you didn't create.
You became the bridge between people who couldn't connect directly.

That skill? It's real. It's valuable.

But it also means you learned to regulate others before you learned to regulate yourself.

The work now is learning that you're allowed to exist without managing everyone else's experience of you.

**CTA:** More in The Bridge. Link in bio.

---

### Post 9: Permission

**Hook:** You don't need their agreement.

**Content:**
You don't need their agreement for your experience to be valid.

You don't need a diagnosis to protect yourself.

You don't need a therapist to validate what your body already knows.

If behavior causes harm, you have the right to name it, address it, and remove yourself from it.

**CTA:** The Narcissism Decoder is in bio.

---

### Post 10: The Promise

**Hook:** The confusion ends when you can name it.

**Content:**
By the end of this journey, you will:

✓ Recognize tactics of control disguised as care
✓ Decode manipulation in real-time
✓ Respond from power rather than reaction
✓ Train your nervous system for secure attachment
✓ Choose relationships that regulate rather than activate

The confusion ends when you can name it.
The healing begins when you practice.

**CTA:** Start with the free Decoder Cards. Link in bio.
