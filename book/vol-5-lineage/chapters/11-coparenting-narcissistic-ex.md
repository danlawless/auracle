# Chapter 11: Co-Parenting With a Narcissistic Ex

## The Impossible Partnership

---

You left. You did the hardest thing. You escaped the relationship that was eroding your sense of self.

And now you discover: you can't fully leave. Because there are children. And children mean contact. Decisions. Handoffs. An ongoing relationship with someone you would never choose to speak to again if you had the choice.

Co-parenting with a narcissistic or high-conflict ex is one of the cruelest psychological challenges a healing parent can face. It requires you to maintain connection with someone who harmed you while simultaneously protecting your children—and yourself.

This chapter offers what you need: strategies that actually work, realistic expectations, and permission to prioritize your sanity.

## The Core Principle

**You cannot co-parent with someone who will not cooperate. What you can do is parallel parent—running two separate systems with minimal intersection.**

The fantasy of healthy co-parenting assumes two adults who can put aside their differences for the good of the children. This fantasy does not survive contact with a narcissistic ex.

With narcissistic personalities, the relationship remains about them—even after it ends. The children become tools for control, punishment, or narcissistic supply. "Co-parenting" becomes another arena for the same dynamics that destroyed the relationship.

The shift from co-parenting to parallel parenting is not giving up. It is strategic adaptation to an impossible situation.

## Field Note: The Negotiation That Never Ended

Every exchange was a battle.

He wanted to pick up the kids at 5. She said 6 was better for the children's schedule. He countered with 4:30—a time that made no sense for anyone but would require her to leave work early.

She explained her reasoning. He dismissed it. She provided documentation from the pediatrician. He accused her of turning the children against him.

Three hours. Three hours of text messages about a thirty-minute difference in pickup time.

By the time she finally agreed to 5:15, she was shaking. Depleted. Unable to be present when the children walked through the door.

*He won,* she thought. And then: *No. He always wins as long as the game is engagement.*

The breakthrough came when she stopped negotiating. "5pm works. See you then." No explanation. No justification. No opening for counter-attack.

He escalated for a few weeks—testing to see if the old patterns still worked. They didn't.

The forty-five minutes she saved per exchange became the forty-five minutes she spent grounding herself before the kids arrived. That was the real victory.

## Understanding the Narcissistic Co-Parent

To navigate this effectively, you need to understand what you're dealing with.

### What Drives Their Behavior

**Need for control:** The relationship ending was a loss of control. Co-parenting offers an avenue to regain it.

**Supply:** Your reactions—frustration, desperation, engagement—are narcissistic supply. The conflict itself feeds them.

**Punishment:** You left. In their world, that's an unforgivable injury. Co-parenting becomes an arena for ongoing retaliation.

**Image management:** They need to be seen as the good parent. This may matter more to them than actually being a good parent.

**The children as extension:** They may not see the children as separate people with their own needs. The children are extensions of themselves—to be used, displayed, controlled.

### Common Tactics in Co-Parenting

| Tactic | What It Looks Like | What They're Getting |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Scheduling warfare** | Constant changes, last-minute demands, manufactured conflicts over times | Control over your life |
| **Financial manipulation** | Withholding support, demanding extras, fighting over every expense | Power through money |
| **Information withholding** | Not telling you about school events, doctor visits, activities | Being the "primary" parent |
| **Parental alienation** | Badmouthing you to the children, undermining your authority, competing for affection | Triangulating the children |
| **Using the children as messengers** | "Tell your mother..." rather than communicating directly | Avoiding accountability |
| **Gatekeeping** | Controlling access to children, making visitation difficult | Punishment for leaving |
| **Legal harassment** | Constant motions, frivolous complaints, weaponizing the court system | Depletion and control |
| **Manufactured crises** | Emergencies that always happen on your time | Disruption and attention |

### The Neuroscience of Ongoing Exposure

Contact with your narcissistic ex activates the same trauma responses the relationship created. Your amygdala has been trained to see this person as a threat. Every text, every exchange, every conflict—even anticipated ones—floods your system with stress hormones.

**This means:** You are not overreacting when pickup time ruins your entire evening. Your nervous system is responding appropriately to a genuine threat.

**This also means:** You need strategies that minimize exposure and maximize recovery time.

## Parallel Parenting: The Alternative Model

When co-parenting isn't possible, parallel parenting is.

### The Difference

| Co-Parenting | Parallel Parenting |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Shared decision-making | Divided decision-making by domain |
| Frequent communication | Minimal, business-like communication |
| Flexibility | Rigid structures and boundaries |
| Unified approach | Two separate but functional systems |
| Requires cooperation | Requires only compliance with agreements |

### The Core Components

**1. Maximum Structure**

The more that is predetermined in legal documents, the less there is to negotiate.

- Specific pickup/dropoff times (not "around dinner time")
- Specific locations (not "we'll figure it out")
- Clear division of expenses (percentages, categories, processes)
- Decision-making authority spelled out
- Communication protocols documented
- Holiday schedules for years ahead

**2. Minimum Communication**

Every communication is an opportunity for conflict. Reduce opportunities.

- Use a parenting app (OurFamilyWizard, TalkingParents) that creates records
- Limit topics to children's health, safety, and logistics
- Don't explain, justify, or defend
- Don't respond to provocations
- Use the 24-hour rule: wait before responding unless urgent

**3. Disengagement From Conflict**

The narcissist needs your engagement. Starve them.

- Drop the rope in every power struggle
- Let them "win" on things that don't matter
- Save your energy for things that do matter
- Don't take the bait, ever

**4. Business-Like Interactions**

Think of them as a difficult colleague, not a former intimate partner.

- Neutral tone
- Brief messages
- No emotional content
- Professional language
- Documentation of everything

## Communication Strategies That Work

### The BIFF Method

Developed by Bill Eddy for high-conflict communication:

- **B**rief: Keep it short
- **I**nformative: Just the facts
- **F**riendly: Neutral to warm tone
- **F**irm: Clear ending, no opening for back-and-forth

**Example:**

*Their message:* "You NEVER told me about the school conference. This is TYPICAL of how you exclude me from my own children's lives. The teachers probably think I'm a terrible parent now thanks to you."

*BIFF response:* "The conference notification was sent by the school on October 3rd. I've confirmed with the office that both parents received it. Let me know if you need the office contact. – [Name]"

No defense. No matching their emotion. No engagement with the accusation.

### The Gray Rock Method

Become as boring and unreactive as a gray rock.

- **No emotional responses** — even to provocations
- **Minimal information** — answer only what is asked
- **Flat affect** — neutral tone in all communication
- **No opinions** — nothing they can argue with
- **No personal information** — nothing about your life, dating, work

**The goal:** Remove the supply they're seeking. If engaging with you is boring, they may find supply elsewhere.

### What Not to Say

| Instead of... | Say... |
|--------------|--------|
| "You always do this" | [Nothing—don't send this message] |
| "That's not fair to the kids" | "Let's focus on the schedule for Saturday." |
| "Fine, whatever you want" | "I'm not able to accommodate that change. The original agreement stands." |
| "You're being unreasonable" | "I'll need to decline. Thanks for understanding." |
| Explaining your reasoning | [Nothing—no explanation needed] |
| Defending yourself | [Nothing—you don't need to be found innocent] |

## Field Note: The Text She Didn't Send

She had written it all out.

A three-paragraph masterpiece explaining exactly why his behavior was damaging the children, citing developmental research, pointing out his hypocrisy, and demanding he take responsibility.

It was articulate. It was factual. It was utterly pointless.

She stared at it for twenty minutes. Imagined sending it. Imagined his response—the deflection, the counter-accusations, the way he'd use her own words against her somehow.

She deleted it.

In its place, she wrote: "Thanks for letting me know. I'll handle it on my end."

The fight he was looking for never arrived.

*This is not weakness,* she reminded herself. *This is strategy.*

## Protecting Your Children

The hardest part of co-parenting with a narcissist is watching your children navigate someone you know to be harmful.

### What You Cannot Control

- What happens at their other parent's house
- What their other parent says about you
- Whether their other parent shows up or lets them down
- How their other parent treats them (within legal limits)
- Whether they develop the same patterns

### What You Can Control

- The environment in your home
- How you respond to what the children share
- How you talk about their other parent
- The stability and regulation you model
- Whether they have a safe adult to process with
- Getting them professional support when needed

### When Children Return From Their Other Parent

Children often come back dysregulated after time with a narcissistic parent. They may be:
- Activated and aggressive
- Withdrawn and shut down
- Testing limits they didn't have at the other house
- Acting out dynamics they witnessed or experienced
- Needing extra connection and regulation

**Your job is not to fix what happened there.** Your job is to provide a regulated environment here.

**Practice:** Build a transition ritual.
- Gentle activities for the first hour
- No immediate questions about their time
- Reconnection through low-demand presence
- Food, rest, calm
- Let them initiate sharing if they want to

### What to Say When They Tell You Hard Things

They will tell you things that make your blood boil. Things that confirm your worst fears about what happens at their other parent's house.

**What not to do:**
- React with visible horror or rage (scares them)
- Interrogate them for details (makes them feel responsible)
- Bad-mouth their other parent (loyalty bind)
- Promise to fix it (may not be possible)
- Minimize it (invalidates their experience)

**What to do:**

Stay regulated. Validate their feelings. Keep them out of the middle.

**Scripts:**

*"That sounds really hard. How did that feel for you?"*

*"Thank you for telling me. It's okay to feel however you feel about that."*

*"You don't have to figure out how to handle that. That's grown-up stuff. You just focus on being a kid."*

*"Both your parents love you, even when we do things differently."*

### The Loyalty Bind

Children love both parents. Even if one parent is harmful, the child cannot afford to stop loving them—both because of attachment and because they may depend on that parent for care.

**This means:** When you criticize their other parent, even accurately, you put them in an impossible bind. They have to choose between you and the parent you're criticizing—and they can't choose.

**The discipline:** Say nothing negative about their other parent in front of them. Process your feelings elsewhere. Vent to your therapist, your friends, your journal—not to your children.

**The exception:** If they share something concerning, you can validate their experience without attacking the other parent: "That wasn't okay. You didn't deserve that. I'm glad you told me."

## Legal Realities

### When to Document

Document everything. Assume everything may eventually end up in front of a judge.

- Keep records of all communication
- Screenshot texts before using apps
- Note dates, times, and witnesses for concerning incidents
- Keep a log of schedule violations
- Save concerning social media posts
- Document children's statements (date, context, exact words)

### When to Involve the Courts

Legal intervention is appropriate when:
- The parenting agreement is being repeatedly violated
- The children's safety is at risk
- Parental alienation is escalating
- You need a third party to enforce boundaries
- Documentation shows a pattern requiring intervention

**Caution:** The legal system is expensive, exhausting, and often disappointing. Narcissists often thrive in adversarial settings. Go to court when necessary, not when frustrated.

### Working With Your Attorney

- Be factual, not emotional
- Focus on what can be proven
- Understand the difference between what's true and what's legally relevant
- Listen to advice about what's achievable
- Don't expect the court to see what you see

## Your Nervous System in Co-Parenting

### Anticipatory Activation

You may notice your nervous system activating before any contact—anticipating the text, dreading the handoff, catastrophizing about the weekend.

**Naming it:** "My nervous system is preparing for threat. This is old survival programming. The threat has not happened yet."

**Intervening:** Use regulation practices before anticipated contact. Don't wait until you're activated.

### Post-Contact Recovery

Build recovery time into your schedule:

- After exchanges, don't schedule demands
- After difficult communications, practice self-regulation
- After legal proceedings, take care of yourself as you would after illness
- After children return, allow transition time for everyone

### The Depletion Cycle

Ongoing conflict depletes your capacity. When capacity is depleted, you have less patience for your children, less ability to regulate, less resilience for the next conflict.

**Breaking the cycle:**
- Reduce discretionary demands
- Increase support systems
- Minimize contact with the narcissistic ex
- Prioritize recovery as essential, not optional

## Field Note: The Weekend She Let Go

He had taken the children on his weekend and gone somewhere he refused to disclose. He had cut off communication. For forty-eight hours, she didn't know where her children were.

When she couldn't reach him, her body went into full survival mode. She called the police. She called her attorney. She paced the house. She imagined every terrible scenario.

The children came home fine. He had taken them camping. It was probably legal. He was probably doing it partly to torture her. And she had spent the entire weekend in a cortisol storm.

The next time he had the children, she made a choice.

She couldn't control what happened on his time. She couldn't make him communicate. She couldn't prevent him from using access to the children as a weapon.

What she could control was whether she spent his weekends in fight-or-flight.

She started a practice: When the children left, she actively handed them over—not just physically, but mentally. "They are with their father. I cannot help them right now. I am going to be present in my own life until I can."

It took months to actually work. But eventually, his weekends became her weekends—for rest, for connection with friends, for being a person instead of just a parent in hypervigilant waiting mode.

*I cannot control what happens there. I can control what happens here.*

## The Long Game

### What You're Really Teaching

When you navigate this well, you teach your children:
- How to maintain boundaries with difficult people
- That they don't have to match someone's energy
- That calm is possible even when others are chaotic
- That their own peace matters
- That they can love someone and still have limits

### What They'll Understand Eventually

They may not see it now. They may blame you for the divorce, prefer the parent who has no boundaries, believe the stories they're told.

But children grow up. And when they do, they often understand what they couldn't see before.

**Your job is not to prove anything now.** Your job is to be the stable, regulated, boundaried parent—and trust that truth reveals itself over time.

### Taking Care of Yourself

You cannot pour from an empty cup. This is not a cliché—it's a survival reality.

- Therapy specifically for co-parenting with a narcissist
- Support groups who understand (general parenting groups may not)
- Friends who can listen without fixing
- Self-care that actually restores (not just numbing)
- Legal support you trust
- Financial planning for ongoing expenses
- Time that is just for you, without children or conflict

## Integration Practice

This week, identify one place where you're still hoping your narcissistic ex will cooperate.

1. Name it: "I'm still hoping they will ____."
2. Reality-test it: "Based on all evidence, is this likely?"
3. Adjust: "If they won't cooperate, what would I do differently?"
4. Implement: Make the change regardless of their behavior

---

## Closing Reflection

Co-parenting with a narcissistic ex is not a partnership. It is a managed conflict.

You did not sign up for this. You did not cause this. And you cannot fix it through being reasonable enough, accommodating enough, or clear enough.

What you can do is protect your peace, maintain your home as a safe haven, model regulation for your children, and trust that your steady presence is giving them something their other parent cannot provide.

The chain breaks not when the narcissist changes—they probably won't. The chain breaks when your children experience a different way. When they see boundaries modeled. When they feel what it's like to be in a regulated home with a regulated parent.

That's what you can offer. That's what matters.

---

## Integration Lines

*"I cannot make them cooperate. I can make myself sane."*

*"Every gray rock response is a deposit in my children's future security."*

*"What I offer at my house is not damaged by what happens at theirs."*

---

*"You left the relationship. You cannot leave the co-parenting. But you can stop fighting a war that was never winnable—and start building peace in the only territory you control: your own."*
