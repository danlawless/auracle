## Author Notes & Key Decisions (Review Round 3)

> **Source:** Author responses from GitHub Issues #220 (Diana), #221 (Morgan), and #246 (Metrics Improvements)
> **Date:** January 4-5, 2026

### Publication Approach
- **Timeline:** Quality-first (6-8 weeks) — comprehensive approach with all polish items
- **Medium Priority Items:** All 18 items approved — extends timeline but prioritizes excellence

### Critical Author Directives
| Decision | Author Choice | Impact |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Content Warnings | **REMOVE ALL** | No content warnings in manuscript |
| Page References | **REMOVE ALL** | Remove all page references for now |
| Glossary Voice | **Clinical passive** | NOT second-person active as originally recommended |
| Em-dash Reduction | **50% reduction** approved | Address rhythmic monotony |
| Part Structure | **5 parts confirmed** | Current TOC structure is final |
| Decoder Card Count | **52 tactical elements** | Resolved discrepancy |

### Metrics Improvement Directives (Issue #246)
| Metric | Target | Author Choice | Impact |
|--------|--------|---------------|--------|
| Coherence (4.2→4.5) | +0.3 | **All C1-C4** | Cross-refs, voice, concept audit, theme markers |
| Flow (3.9→4.5) | +0.6 | **F1-F5 (skip F6)** | Pause points, Ch.3 restructure, breathing room, time estimates |
| Popularity (4.5→4.7) | +0.2 | **P1-P3, P5 (skip P4)** | Shareable content, Tier 4 enhancement, interactive elements, hooks |

### Structural Decisions from Diana (Developmental Editor)
| Item | Decision | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Decoder Cards | Consolidate to **one chapter** | Internal divisions, easier reference |
| Exposure Questions | **Move much earlier** | Functions as confirmation tool early |
| Chapter 10 Placement | **Keep after Chapter 9** | Current position confirmed |
| Co-parenting | **Add section/chapter** | Many readers share children with narcissists |
| Workplace Content | **Expand Chapter 12** | Deeper coverage within existing structure |
| Discernment Section | **Add chapter/section** | Help readers identify non-narcissistic dynamics |
| Romantic Manipulation | **Add BOTH** healthy romance AND mid-level narcissism | Readers in mid-level relationships should feel seen |
| Family Section | **Keep all four chapters** | Family narcissism deserves deep coverage |
| Pause Files | **Integrate into chapter endings** | More natural, less skippable |

### Morgan (Managing Editor) Verification Decisions
| Item | Decision | Action Required |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Cross-references | Unsure, verify needed | **Systematic audit required** after renumbering |
| Mother-Father Balance | Expand Father Wound | Create balance between sections |
| Fact-check: Gloria Steinem | Verify attribution | "Popularized by" adjustment may be needed |
| Fact-check: Frog metaphor | Already removed | No action needed |
| Fact-check: 72-hour timeline | Keep disclaimer as-is | No change |
| Fact-check: "Ancient fable" | Author uncertain | Consider "ancient?" or leave as-is |
