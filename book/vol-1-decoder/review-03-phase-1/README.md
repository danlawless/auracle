# Review Round 3 - Phase 1: Strategic Decisions

**Volume:** Vol. 1: The Narcissism Decoder
**Created:** January 4, 2026
**Status:** ACTIVE - Awaiting author decisions

---

## Why Phase 1 First?

**Principle:** Big-picture changes first, fine details last — structural changes invalidate detailed polish work.

Phase 1 reviewers (Diana and Morgan) address **strategic decisions** that affect everything downstream:
- Chapter order and structure
- Part organization
- Theme emphasis
- Reader journey design
- Publication priorities

**Critical Rule:** Answer ALL Phase 1 questions before implementing ANY changes or moving to Phase 2.

## Workflow

3. **Document Decisions** - Record answers in `author-decisions.md`

5. **Proceed to Phase 2** - Only after Phase 1 is complete
