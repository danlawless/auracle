# Chapter 3: When Helping Is Hiding

## The Disguise That Looks Like Generosity

---

This is the chapter you might resist.

It asks a question that threatens the helper's identity:

**What if the helping isn't about them—it's about avoiding yourself?**

What if all the time, energy, and attention you pour into others is a sophisticated strategy for not looking at your own material?

What if your generosity is a disguise?

This is uncomfortable. But it's also necessary.

Because helping that hides is not actually helping. It's self-abandonment wearing the mask of service.

## Field Note (Before): The Selfless One

She was known for having no needs.

Always available. Never complaining. The first to volunteer and the last to ask for anything in return.

"She's so selfless," people would say, with admiration.

But her therapist saw something different.

"When's the last time you attended to your own needs?" the therapist asked.

She paused. Then: "I don't really have needs. I mean, not like other people."

The therapist waited.

"Okay," she admitted. "I guess I don't let myself have needs. It's easier to focus on everyone else."

"Easier how?"

She felt the familiar tightness in her chest. The thing she didn't want to look at. The darkness she had been orbiting for years, never quite entering.

"If I stop focusing on everyone else, I'll have to focus on me. And I don't want to look at what's there."

The selflessness wasn't generosity. It was avoidance with a halo.

## Field Note (After): The Woman Who Finally Sat Still

Three years later, same woman.

She still helps. But less. And differently.

When the urge to help arises, she pauses. Asks: *Is this mine to do? Or am I using this to not be with myself?*

Sometimes the answer is clear—this is genuine service, and she has capacity. She gives freely.

Sometimes the answer is uncomfortable—this is avoidance in disguise. She recognizes the pull toward escape and chooses differently. She sits still. She feels what's there.

The people around her are confused at first. Some are disappointed—they'd grown accustomed to her endless availability.

But she's more present now. When she helps, it's cleaner. And when she's alone with herself, she can finally bear it.

The darkness she'd been avoiding? She found grief in there. And underneath the grief, rest.

## The Anatomy of Hiding in Helping

Hiding in helping has a recognizable structure:

**Step 1: The discomfort arises.**
You feel something you don't want to feel. Emptiness. Grief. Fear. Shame. Old memories surfacing. Uncomfortable truths about your life.

**Step 2: The helper impulse activates.**
Instead of staying with the discomfort, you pivot outward. *Who needs me? What can I do? Where is there a problem I can solve?*

**Step 3: The focus shifts.**
Your attention leaves your own experience and locks onto someone else's. Now their problem is the problem. Their pain is what needs tending. Your discomfort fades to background noise.

**Step 4: The temporary relief.**
It works—sort of. The helping creates a sense of purpose, connection, and distraction. You feel better. You feel useful. You feel like yourself again.

**Step 5: The discomfort returns.**
Because it was never actually processed. It was just displaced. So it comes back. And you need to help again. And again. And again.

This is the cycle of hiding in helping.

## What You Might Be Hiding From

The content varies, but common themes emerge:

**Your own grief.**
Loss you haven't fully mourned. Relationships that ended. Dreams that didn't come true. Parts of yourself you had to abandon. Helping others grieve is easier than grieving yourself.

**Your own wounds.**
Trauma you haven't fully processed. Abuse you've named but not metabolized. Patterns you understand intellectually but haven't felt through. Helping others heal their wounds is easier than healing yours.

**Your own emptiness.**
The void that opens when you're not useful. The question of who you are when you're not needed. The fear that without a function, you might be nothing. Helping fills the emptiness—temporarily.

**Your own needs.**
Needs you've learned to suppress. Needs that weren't met in childhood. Needs that feel shameful or dangerous to acknowledge. Helping others with their needs is easier than facing your own.

**Your own powerlessness.**
The fundamental helplessness of the human condition. The things you can't control. The suffering you can't prevent. Helping creates an illusion of control—if you can save them, maybe you're not so helpless after all.

**Your own dissatisfaction.**
With your relationship, your career, your life. Rather than face what isn't working and make difficult changes, you focus on others. Their lives become more interesting than yours—because yours is too painful to examine.

**Your own mortality.**
At the deepest level, some helping is an attempt to outrun death. To create meaning. To leave a legacy. To matter. To not disappear. Facing mortality directly is harder than staying busy serving.

## The Twelve Signs

How do you know if your helping is hiding?

Watch for these indicators:

**1. You can't stop.**
You say you want to cut back, but you don't. You recognize you're overextended, but you keep saying yes. The compulsion is stronger than your stated intention.

**2. Sitting still feels unbearable.**
When you're not helping, you feel restless, anxious, or depressed. Stillness brings up content you don't want to face. You'd rather be busy.

**3. Your own life is neglected.**
Your house, your health, your relationships, your creative projects—they're on hold while you attend to others. Your life is always deprioritized for someone else's emergency.

**4. You feel resentful—but won't stop.**
Part of you is angry about how much you give. But you don't reduce the giving. You just carry the resentment alongside it.

**5. Being needed feels better than being loved.**
You're more comfortable being useful than being wanted for yourself. The helper role feels safer than vulnerability.

**6. You don't know who you are when you're not helping.**
Your identity is fused with the helper function. Without someone to help, you feel purposeless. "Helper" isn't something you do—it's who you are.

**7. You get anxious when they don't need you.**
Their independence threatens you. If they're okay, what's your role? You might find yourself subtly undermining their progress—or feeling relieved when they struggle again.

**8. You avoid people who would challenge you.**
You surround yourself with people who need you, not people who see you. Those who would push you to grow are kept at a distance.

**9. You rarely receive.**
The flow only goes one way—out. When people try to give to you, you deflect, minimize, or redirect to their needs. You don't know how to take in.

**10. Your helping has urgency.**
It doesn't feel like a choice—it feels like a compulsion. There's a driven quality, a sense that you have to help now. This urgency is often sourced in your material, not theirs.

**11. You choose helpers who need help over helpers who don't.**
In your own relationships, you pick fixer-uppers. Not because you're drawn to their essence—because you're drawn to their brokenness. It gives you something to do.

**12. Underneath the helping, there's exhaustion.**
Not physical tiredness—soul tiredness. A deep weariness that rest doesn't touch. Because you've been running for so long.

## Neuroscience Lens: The Avoidance Circuit

Your brain has well-established circuits for avoidance—and they can hijack helping behavior.

**The Amygdala and Threat Detection:**
When painful material approaches consciousness, your amygdala registers it as threat. It triggers the same circuits that would activate if you encountered a physical danger.

For trauma survivors, this threat response is often heightened. Internal experience—your own emotions, memories, sensations—can feel genuinely dangerous. The brain treats inner material the same way it would treat an external predator.

**The Pivoting Response:**
When threatened, the brain looks for escape routes. If physical escape isn't available, it pivots to other strategies: distraction, suppression, action.

Helping is a particularly elegant pivot. It redirects attention outward. It creates a sense of purpose. It triggers dopamine (reward). And it's socially praised—no one questions the person who's "always there for others."

**The Numbing of Self-Awareness:**
Chronic other-focus can actually reduce activity in the brain regions associated with self-awareness. You don't just distract from yourself—you gradually lose the capacity for self-reflection.

This is why long-term helper-hiders often have difficulty answering basic questions about their own feelings, needs, or desires. The circuits for self-awareness have atrophied.

**The Freeze Response:**
Interestingly, some hiding in helping is actually a freeze response in disguise. Rather than fight or flight, the person freezes—but it looks like action because they're so busy with others. The inner freezing (emotional deadness, disconnection from self) is masked by outer activity.

**Translation:** Your nervous system may have learned that helping is safer than feeling. Unlearning this requires patient, repeated practice of staying with internal experience.

## Field Note: The Coach Who Filled Her Calendar

She noticed it first in her scheduling.

Her calendar was always full. Not with clients—she wasn't that busy with paid work. But with friends who needed support. Family members in crisis. Volunteer commitments. Anyone who needed anything.

The moment a slot opened, she'd fill it.

Her coach asked: "What would happen if you left a day empty?"

She felt the panic immediately. "I don't know. I'd probably just... sit there."

"And what would happen then?"

"I'd feel useless. Or I'd have to think about my life. My marriage isn't great. My own goals are stalled. If I stop helping everyone, I'll have to face all of that."

She recognized it then. The busy calendar wasn't generosity. It was a defensive structure against her own life.

That recognition changed everything—not immediately, but gradually. She started leaving gaps. Sitting with the discomfort. Facing what was there.

Her marriage eventually ended. But it needed to. She'd been using helping to avoid that truth for years.

## The Self-Abandonment Structure

Hiding in helping is a form of self-abandonment.

You leave yourself—your needs, your pain, your life—to attend to others.

This mirrors what may have happened in your family of origin:

- If your parents' needs always came first, you learned that your needs don't matter.
- If you were only valued for what you provided, you learned that your worth is in your function.
- If attending to yourself was called selfish, you learned to feel guilty about your own needs.
- If no one was there for you, you learned not to expect care—and to provide it instead.

**Hiding in helping is the perpetuation of childhood patterns into adulthood.**

You're doing to yourself what was done to you: abandoning your inner experience to focus on others.

The difference is that now, you're the one doing the abandoning. Which means you're also the one who can stop.

## Field Note: The Sponsor Who Couldn't Sit with Himself

He'd been sober for fifteen years. A respected sponsor in his recovery community.

He had five sponsees. Took calls at any hour. Never missed a meeting. Was known for his availability.

But his own sponsor noticed something.

"When's the last time you did your own step work?" the old-timer asked.

He deflected. "I've done the steps."

"Have you done them recently? Is there something you're avoiding?"

He bristled. Then softened. The old-timer knew him too well.

"There's grief I haven't touched," he admitted. "About my father. He died while I was still using, and I never really... I just haven't gone there."

"And the sponsoring? Does it help you not go there?"

The question landed. Of course it did. Every time the grief approached, there was a sponsee in crisis. Every time he was alone, his phone rang. It wasn't coincidence—he'd built a life where he never had to be with himself.

"I think I need to take a break," he said.

It took six months. Six months of sitting with the grief he'd been running from for fifteen years. It was the hardest work he'd done since getting sober.

When he came back to sponsoring, it was different. Cleaner. Because he wasn't using their recovery to avoid his own.

## What Clean Helping Looks Like

For contrast, here's what helping looks like when it's not hiding:

**You can choose not to help.**
There's no compulsion. You can say no, and you don't feel like you're abandoning your identity. You help because you want to, not because you have to.

**You can sit still.**
When you're alone, you can be with yourself. Stillness doesn't trigger panic or frantic activity. You're okay being unneeded.

**Your own life is tended.**
Your health, relationships, home, and personal goals get attention. You're not sacrificing your life for others—you're living your life, and helping is part of it.

**You feel satisfied, not resentful.**
Helping feels good—and complete. You're not accumulating a ledger of unreturned favors. You give freely and release.

**You can receive.**
When people offer you care, you can take it in. You don't have to deflect, minimize, or quickly redirect to their needs.

**You know who you are beyond helping.**
The role is something you do, not something you are. You have other sources of identity, meaning, and purpose.

**You're happy when they don't need you.**
Their growth and independence is the goal. When they no longer need you, you feel accomplished, not abandoned.

## The Invitation Underneath

Hiding in helping often contains a secret invitation:

**Come find me.**

Buried underneath all the other-focus is a longing to be found. To be sought after for who you are, not what you provide. To have someone pursue you instead of the other way around.

But the hiding makes this impossible. The more you hide in helping, the more invisible you become. People see the helper function, not the person underneath. And so the longing goes unmet—which drives more hiding—which creates more invisibility.

**The way out is counterintuitive:**

You have to stop hiding to be found. You have to show yourself—your needs, your vulnerabilities, your non-helper self—to be truly seen.

This requires letting the helper mask drop. Allowing people to meet you in your human messiness. Risking that without the function, you might be less valued—but discovering that the right people will value you more.

## A Practice: The Avoidance Audit

Use this when you notice the urge to help:

**Step 1: Pause before acting.**
When the helper impulse arises, don't act immediately. Take three breaths.

**Step 2: Check your interior.**
What's happening inside you right now? What feeling or experience was present before the impulse arose?

**Step 3: Ask the question.**
"Am I moving toward something—or away from something?"

If toward: What am I genuinely called to give here?
If away: What am I avoiding by focusing on this?

**Step 4: Name what you're running from.**
If this is avoidance, name it specifically. "I'm running from the conversation I need to have with my partner." "I'm avoiding the grief about my mother." "I'm hiding from the emptiness."

**Step 5: Decide consciously.**
You might still choose to help—but now it's a choice, not an automatic escape. And you know what you'll need to come back to later.

## A Practice: The Stillness Challenge

For one week:

1. **Build in gaps.** Schedule at least two hours each day where you have nothing planned and no one to help.

2. **Notice the pull.** When the urge to fill the gaps arises (text someone, check on someone, offer something), don't act on it. Just notice.

3. **Stay with what's there.** Whatever comes up in the stillness—sit with it. You don't have to fix it. Just experience it.

4. **Journal the content.** What thoughts, feelings, or sensations appeared when you stopped helping? What were you avoiding?

5. **Reflect.** At the end of the week, what did you learn about what hiding underneath your helping?

This practice is harder than it sounds. The pull toward activity can be powerful. Treat the discomfort as information.

---

## A Practice: The Return to Self

Use this after helping interactions where you may have over-given:

**Step 1: Physical return.**
Feel your body. Notice your feet on the ground. Your breath in your chest. The weight of your body in the chair.

**Step 2: Energetic return.**
Imagine calling back any attention or energy you left with the other person. Not coldly—just clearly. What's theirs is theirs. What's yours returns to you.

**Step 3: Self-inquiry.**
Ask: "What do I need right now?" Listen for the answer. It might be rest, food, movement, solitude, or connection with someone who can hold you.

**Step 4: Meet the need.**
Don't skip to the next helping task. Tend to yourself first. Even if briefly.

This trains the pattern of returning—instead of perpetually giving outward without coming back.

## Reader Reflection

- When I'm alone with nothing to do, what comes up?
- What am I using helping to avoid?
- Who would I be if I weren't the helper?
- What grief, fear, or truth am I running from?
- What would I have to face if I stopped focusing on everyone else?
- Can I tolerate being still? For how long?
- What is the invitation underneath my hiding?

**Body cue to notice:** The relief when someone needs you, the panic when you're not needed, the restlessness in stillness

**Practice:** Avoidance Audit (before helping interactions), Stillness Challenge (weekly)

## When Helping Becomes Insight-Projection

There's a particular form of hiding that deserves special attention: **using insight to control others while avoiding your own material.**

### The Pattern

You see something in them. A pattern. A wound. A blind spot.

And you offer it. Not because they asked—but because you saw it.

**What feels like service is actually:**
- A way to stay in the expert position
- A way to regulate your own anxiety
- A way to avoid your own process
- A way to maintain hierarchy

### Why This Is Particularly Seductive

Insight feels like generosity. You're giving them something valuable—your perception, your framework, your wisdom.

But insight offered without invitation is often:
- Identity-protective ("I am the one who sees")
- Anxiety-regulating ("If I name it, I can manage it")
- Distance-creating ("As long as I'm analyzing, I don't have to feel")

**One-Line Decoder:** If your insight about them makes you feel better—check whether you're hiding.

### The Alternative

**Before offering insight:**
1. Am I offering because they want this, or because I need to give it?
2. Am I staying with my own discomfort or redirecting through analysis?
3. Would silence serve them better?
4. Is my insight contaminated by my need to be valuable?

**For deeper exploration of when insight becomes control, see Volume 4, Chapter 18: The Shadow of the Healer.**

## Closing Note for This Chapter

If you recognized yourself in these pages, that's not an indictment.

Many of the world's best helpers started here—hiding in service, avoiding themselves through other-focus.

**The recognition is the beginning of change.**

You can't stop hiding until you see that you're hiding. And now you see.

This doesn't mean you should stop helping. It means you should clean your helping. Ensure it's not contaminated with avoidance. Ensure you're serving from fullness, not fleeing from emptiness.

The work ahead involves:
- Facing what you've been avoiding
- Tolerating stillness and its contents
- Building an identity beyond the helper role
- Learning to receive, not just give
- Letting yourself be found

This is harder than helping others. It's also more important.

Because until you stop hiding in helping, your helping will always be compromised—by desperation, dependency, and the unconscious need to stay busy.

**The goal isn't to stop helping. It's to help freely—as a choice, not an escape.**

That requires facing yourself. All of yourself.

Even the parts you've been running from.
