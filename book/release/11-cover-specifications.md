## Design Recommendations

### Color Palette (Series Consistency)

**Volume 1: The Narcissism Decoder**

Consider darker, more intense tones that suggest "decoding" and revelation:

- Primary: Deep charcoal or black (#1a1a1a)
- Accent: Gold or amber (#d4a857) — suggests illumination, truth revealed
- Text: White or cream for contrast

**Volume 2: The Bridge**

Consider warmer, softer tones that suggest healing and transition:

- Primary: Deep teal or forest green (#2d4a43) — suggests growth, calm
- Accent: Warm gold or soft copper (#c5a47e) — continuity with Vol 1
- Text: Cream or warm white

**Series Cohesion:**
- Use the same font family across both covers
- Keep accent color consistent (gold/amber)
- Similar layout structure (title position, author name placement)

---

### Typography Recommendations

**Title Fonts (choose one style):**

*Serif (Classic, authoritative):*
- Playfair Display
- Cormorant Garamond
- Libre Baskerville

*Sans-Serif (Modern, clean):*
- Montserrat
- Raleway
- Josefin Sans

*Display (Distinctive, memorable):*
- Cinzel (elegant, structured)
- Yeseva One (bold, impactful)

**Subtitle/Author Name:**
- Use a complementary font (if title is serif, subtitle can be sans-serif)
- Keep author name smaller but clearly legible
- Consider all caps for author name

**Size Hierarchy:**
1. Title (largest)
2. Subtitle (medium)
3. Author name (smallest but readable)

---

### Cover Elements

**What to Include:**

✓ Title (prominent, readable at small size)
✓ Subtitle (if space allows)
✓ Author name
✓ Simple imagery or texture (optional)

**What to Avoid:**

✗ Busy backgrounds
✗ Hard-to-read fonts
✗ Too many colors
✗ Stock photos with people (often looks cheap)
✗ Borders or frames (can look dated)
