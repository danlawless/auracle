## Post Title

**Start Here: Your Roadmap to Freedom**

---

## Post Content

---

Welcome. I'm glad you found your way here.

If you're reading this, something felt off enough to start searching. Maybe a relationship that left you questioning your own sanity. Maybe a family dynamic that drained you no matter how much you gave. Maybe you're just starting to wake up to patterns you lived with your entire life.

**You're in the right place.**

This newsletter is about one thing: helping you recognize manipulation, heal attachment wounds, and build relationships that regulate rather than activate.

Let me show you around.

## Who I Am

I'm Jennifer Brooke. I hold a Master's in Mental Health Counseling, and I spent years in traditional therapy—both as a practitioner and as someone trying to heal.

What I learned: insight alone doesn't heal. You can understand everything and still react the same way.

So I went searching. Three years of travel. Spiritual community. Nervous system work. Shadow integration. The slow, body-level healing that actually changes how you move through the world.

I wrote two books from that journey:

**The Narcissism Decoder** — Recognizing control disguised as care
**The Bridge** — Moving from insight to embodiment

This newsletter continues that work, one week at a time.

---

## What You'll Get Here

Every week, I send one email containing:

- **A pattern named** — Something you've felt but couldn't articulate
- **A reframe** — A new way to understand what happened  
- **A practice** — Something you can actually do

No overwhelm. No daily content. Just one meaningful email designed to help you feel more grounded in your own experience.

The confusion ends when you can name the pattern.

The healing begins when your nervous system learns something new.

This work takes time. Go slowly. Come back when you need to.

I'm here.
