## A Note Before You Begin

> *You picked up this book because you don't want to pass it on.*
>
> *That awareness alone is already breaking the chain.*
>
> *What follows is not a manual for perfect parenting. It is a guide for conscious parenting — parenting while healing, parenting while triggered, parenting while still figuring out who you are.*
>
> *Your children don't need you to be healed. They need you to be healing.*
>
> *That's what you're giving them: a parent who is aware, who repairs, who keeps choosing growth.*
>
> *The chain breaks with you.*
