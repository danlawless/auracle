# Chapter 25: Epilogue + Reader Blessing

---

## Epilogue

I didn't write this book because I have it all figured out.

I wrote it because I walked the bridge—and I'm still walking.

There were days when I wanted to go back. When the old patterns felt safer than the uncertainty of change. When guilt convinced me I was the problem. When my body screamed for intensity because it was the only form of connection I knew.

And there were days when something shifted. When calm didn't feel wrong. When I trusted my perception without external validation. When I chose steady over electric—and it was enough.

Healing is not a straight line. It circles back. It surprises you. It humbles you.

But if you keep walking, the ground gets more solid.

I don't know where you are as you read this. Maybe at the beginning—just waking up to patterns you couldn't name before. Maybe in the middle—tired, frustrated, wondering if any of this is working. Maybe nearing something that feels like the other side—where peace doesn't feel like waiting.

Wherever you are, you belong here.

The bridge holds.

And so do you.

## A Reader Blessing

*May you trust what your body already knows.*

*May you stop explaining yourself to those who refuse to listen.*

*May you feel guilt and set the boundary anyway.*

*May you grieve what you deserved but did not receive.*

*May calm become your home, not a waiting room.*

*May you attract what matches your healing, not your wounding.*

*May you know—in your bones, not just your mind—that you are safe.*

*May the bridge hold.*

*And may you cross it, again and again, until crossing becomes walking becomes living becomes you.*

## Closing Words

You were never the problem.

You were adapting.

And now you are choosing.

Thank you for trusting this journey. Thank you for doing the hard work of change. Thank you for not giving up—on yourself, on the possibility of peace, on the quiet courage of becoming.

The bridge is yours now.

Walk it well.

*With respect and gratitude,*

*The Author*

## What Comes Next

If you found value in this book:

- Return to the chapters that resonated most
- Practice the tools until they become second nature
- Share the decoder cards with those on similar paths
- Consider revisiting the Secure Attachment Training Arc (Chapter 19) as a structured practice
- Join communities of others doing this work—healing happens in connection

And if you read Volume 1 (*The Narcissism Decoder*), you now have both pieces: the recognition and the replacement.

**The language to name what happened. And the practice to build what comes next.**

## One Last Thing

If no one has said it to you lately:

**I'm proud of you.**

Not for being perfect. Not for having it figured out. But for being here, at the end of a book that asked a lot of you, still willing to try.

That's not nothing.

That's everything.

*"You were adapting—and now you are choosing."*
