### Script

This lesson may be the most difficult in the course.

When the narcissist is your parent, the wound goes to your foundation. Before you knew what normal looked like, before you had words for what was happening, the patterns were being written into your nervous system.

This is different from being manipulated by a partner you met as an adult. This is the original template.

**Why parental narcissism is different**

When you experience manipulation from a partner, friend, or boss, you have a baseline to compare against. You remember who you were before. You know, somewhere, that this isn't right.

When your parent is the narcissist, you have no baseline.

This is how you learned what love looks like. This is how you learned what you deserve. This is what "normal" means, because you've never known anything else.

The conditional approval, the emotional volatility, the need to manage their feelings—you thought everyone lived this way.

**The core wound**

Every child needs to be seen—not for what they produce, not for how they reflect on the parent, but for who they are.

A child with a narcissistic parent learns something devastating: **I am not seen. What I truly am is not enough.**

Instead, they learn: I am valuable when I perform correctly. I am safe when I manage their emotions. I am lovable when I'm what they need me to be.

This becomes the template for all future relationships. They seek partners who replicate the dynamic. They work to earn love that should have been given freely. They don't know that love without conditions exists.

**The specific patterns**

**The enmeshed parent**

Some narcissistic parents don't allow separation. The child is treated as an extension of the parent, not a separate person.

"We think this." "We want that." "You're just like me."

The child's job is to reflect the parent's glory. Their successes are the parent's successes. Their own desires—especially ones that differ from the parent's—are threats.

**The dismissive parent**

Other narcissistic parents are simply unavailable. They're preoccupied with their own needs, their own drama, their own life.

The child learns: I am not interesting. My needs are burdensome. I should be low-maintenance.

This can be harder to identify than active abuse because nothing overtly "happened." But neglect is its own injury.

**The oscillating parent**

Many narcissistic parents oscillate between enmeshment and dismissal.

Sometimes they're overwhelming—calling constantly, needing to know everything, involving themselves in every decision. Other times they're completely unavailable—ignoring calls, forgetting birthdays, lost in their own world.

The child never knows which parent will show up. They stay hypervigilant, constantly adjusting.

**The parent who uses the child**

This parent treats the child as a tool.

They might use the child to fight their battles—sending them to confront the other parent, enlisting them as allies in adult conflicts.

They might use the child as a confidant—sharing inappropriate information about their marriage, their resentments, their unmet needs.

They might use the child for supply—requiring constant attention, reassurance, or achievement to feel good about themselves.

The child learns: My job is to serve. My needs are secondary. My function is to meet someone else's needs.

**Breaking the loyalty bond**

One of the most painful aspects of parental narcissism is the conflict it creates.

Your parent is supposed to love you. When they hurt you, your brain has to make sense of it. Usually, it decides: I must be the problem.

Acknowledging a parent's narcissism feels like betrayal. There's often intense guilt, as if naming the reality is the crime—not the behavior itself.

But here's the truth: Naming what happened is not disloyalty. It's accuracy.

You can love someone and recognize that they harmed you. You can grieve the parent you needed and accept the parent you had. You can honor the relationship while also protecting yourself from ongoing harm.

These aren't contradictions. They're integration.

**What healing looks like**

Healing from a narcissistic parent is complex work. Here are the elements:

**Grief.** You have to mourn the parent you should have had. The one who would have seen you, celebrated you, protected you. That parent either never existed or wasn't available to you. The loss is real.

**Re-parenting.** The nurturing you didn't receive can be developed now—through therapy, through safe relationships, through self-compassion practices. It's never too late to receive what you needed.

**Boundaries.** You get to decide what relationship, if any, you have with this parent going forward. That might mean low contact. It might mean no contact. It might mean structured contact with clear limits. All of these are valid.

**Breaking the template.** The patterns you learned will show up in other relationships. Recognizing them allows choice: "This is my old pattern. I can choose something different."

**Integration.** Eventually, you can hold the complexity—the harm and whatever good there was, the grief and the liberation, the parent who hurt you and the human who also struggled. This isn't forgiveness on demand. It's coming to peace with a complicated truth.

**You deserved better**

Before we move on, I need you to hear this:

You deserved a parent who was interested in who you actually are.
You deserved safety without performance.
You deserved love that wasn't conditional on meeting their needs.
You deserved to be seen.

You didn't get that. And that wasn't your fault.

The child you were didn't do anything wrong. They adapted the best they could to impossible circumstances. They survived.

Now, as an adult, you get to write a different story.

**In our next lesson,** we'll shift to romantic relationships—how the patterns learned in family play out in intimate partnership.

## Exercise

**Parental Wound Inventory**

**Part 1: The Pattern**

Reflect on your relationship with your narcissistic parent:

1. How did they respond when you had needs that conflicted with theirs?
2. What happened when you succeeded? Failed?
3. Were you seen as your own person, or as a reflection of them?
4. What did you have to do to receive approval?
5. What happened when you said "no" or set a boundary?

**Part 2: The Template**

How do these patterns show up in your adult relationships?

| Childhood Pattern | Adult Echo |
|-------------------|------------|
| Ex: Had to manage parent's emotions | Ex: Choose partners who need managing |
| | |
| | |

**Part 3: What You Needed**

Complete these sentences:
- As a child, I needed...
- Instead, I got...
- I deserved...

**Part 4: Moving Forward**

What might it look like to give yourself now what you didn't receive then?
