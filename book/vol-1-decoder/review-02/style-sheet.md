# Vol-1: The Narcissism Decoder - Editorial Style Sheet

## Document Purpose
This style sheet documents all editorial decisions for consistency throughout the manuscript. Created by Clara, Copy Editor.

---

## 1. Grammar & Syntax Standards

### Subject-Verb Agreement
- Collective nouns treated as singular (e.g., "the family is" not "the family are")
- "Data" treated as plural in formal contexts, singular acceptable in conversational tone

### Pronoun Usage
- Singular "they" acceptable for gender-neutral singular reference
- Author uses "he/him" in examples as stated in front matter; this is intentional and documented
- "You" used consistently to address reader directly
- "We" used for collaborative tone (per project guidelines)

### Modifiers
- Avoid dangling modifiers
- Place modifiers close to the words they modify

### Parallel Structure
- Lists must maintain parallel grammatical structure
- Example: "Recognizing, Understanding, and Breaking Free" (all -ing forms)

### Intentional Fragments
- Allowed for stylistic effect in conversational passages
- Example: "That's the only test you need." - Acceptable
- Must serve rhetorical purpose, not represent incomplete thoughts

---

## 2. Punctuation Conventions

### Serial Comma (Oxford Comma)
**Decision: USE SERIAL COMMA**
- Example: "isolation, financial control, monitoring activities, and control"
- Apply consistently throughout manuscript

### Em Dash (—)
- Use em dash without spaces: "control—they want"
- Used for:
  - Emphasis or interruption
  - Setting off parenthetical information
  - Attribution of quotes
- No hyphen-hyphen (--) substitutes

### En Dash (–)
- Use for ranges: "pages 10–15"
- Use for compound modifiers with open compounds: "New York–based"

### Hyphens
- Compound modifiers before nouns: "well-documented patterns"
- No hyphen after -ly adverbs: "frequently used tactic"
- Age descriptors: "50-year-old woman"
- Compound numbers: "twenty-one"

### Quotation Marks
- Use straight quotes for consistency in markdown
- Periods and commas inside closing quotes (American style)
- Colons and semicolons outside closing quotes
- Question marks and exclamation points: inside if part of quote, outside if not

### Ellipsis
- Use three periods with spaces: ". . ." for omissions within quotes
- Use three periods without spaces: "..." for trailing off in dialogue/thought
- **Decision: Use "..." (no spaces) for stylistic effect**

### Colons
- Lowercase after colon unless followed by complete sentence or quote
- Use colon to introduce lists

### Semicolons
- Join related independent clauses
- Separate complex list items

- who/whom: "who" (subject), "whom" (object)

### Compound Words - Status Log
| Term | Treatment | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|

| love-bombing | hyphenated | |
| trauma bond | open | as noun |
| trauma-bonded | hyphenated | as modifier (e.g., "trauma-bonded relationship") |
| scapegoat | one word | |
| gaslighting | one word | |
| breadcrumbing | one word | |
| self-care | hyphenated | |
| wellbeing | one word | per style decision |

### Psychological Term Modifiers
When psychological terms function as compound modifiers before a noun, hyphenate them:
- trauma-bonded (as in "trauma-bonded relationship")
- abuse-related (as in "abuse-related symptoms")
- narcissism-induced (as in "narcissism-induced confusion")

When these same terms function as predicate adjectives (after the noun), do not hyphenate:
