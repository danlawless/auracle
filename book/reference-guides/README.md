## Core Principles Across All Volumes

1. **You were never the problem.** You were adapting to survive.

2. **Naming creates power.** When you name what's happening, it stops happening TO you.

3. **The body keeps the score.** Healing requires nervous system work, not just insight.

4. **Secure attachment is learned.** It's a skill, not a fixed trait.

5. **Compassion without self-abandonment.** You can hold compassion while protecting yourself.

6. **Sovereignty is not separation.** It's self-trust without urgency.

7. **Your presence is your power.** When you trust yourself, everything changes.

8. **Breaking the chain is possible.** You can give what you didn't receive.

9. **Thriving is not betrayal.** You are allowed to build a beautiful life.
