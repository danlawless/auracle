# Appendix A: Financial Recovery Checklist

## A Practical Roadmap for Rebuilding After Financial Abuse

---

Financial recovery after abuse is not just about money. It's about reclaiming your sense of agency, safety, and future.

This checklist provides a practical framework for rebuilding—whether you're starting from zero, climbing out of debt, or simply learning to trust yourself with money for the first time.

**A note before you begin:** If managing money feels overwhelming, that's not weakness—it's a trauma response. Financial abuse often leaves the nervous system dysregulated around anything involving money. Go slowly. Return to your regulation practices when needed. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

## How to Use This Checklist

1. **Start where you are.** Not everyone begins at Phase 1. Find your current phase and work forward.
2. **Check what's done, note what's next.** This is a working document.
3. **Don't rush.** Each phase can take weeks or months. That's normal.
4. **Celebrate small wins.** Each checked box is evidence of your sovereignty.
5. **Return when triggered.** This checklist will be here when you're ready.

## Phase 5: Debt Management

*Focus: Creating a plan for existing debt*

**Reminder:** Many abuse survivors carry debt that was incurred through coercion, fraud, or survival necessity. This debt is not a moral failing.

### Debt Inventory

| Creditor | Balance | Interest Rate | Minimum Payment | Status |
|----------|---------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**Total Debt:** __________
**Total Minimum Payments:** __________/month

### Debt Strategy

Choose your approach:

**Option A: Debt Avalanche** (mathematically optimal)
- Pay minimums on all debts
- Put extra money toward highest interest rate debt
- When paid off, roll that payment to next highest rate

**Option B: Debt Snowball** (psychologically powerful)
- Pay minimums on all debts
- Put extra money toward smallest balance
- When paid off, roll that payment to next smallest
- Quick wins build momentum

**For trauma survivors:** The snowball method often works better because early wins help rewire the nervous system's relationship with money. Choose what will keep you going.

### Debt Reduction Actions

### Credit Repair
