## 💬 A Note Before You Begin

> *This book is for those who learned to survive connection before they learned to feel safe in it.*
>
> *For those who grew up in homes where love was inconsistent, emotions were overwhelming, or roles were assigned before choice was possible.*
>
> *You are not broken. You are between worlds.*
>
> *One world taught you to regulate others, anticipate emotions, and maintain connection at any cost. The other asks you to stay present, grounded, and sovereign—without disappearing or hardening.*
>
> *This book is the bridge between those worlds.*

## 🌉 The Core Principle

**Secure attachment is not found—it is practiced.**

Your nervous system learned safety through:
- Vigilance
- Anticipation
- Intensity
- Compliance
- Caretaking

Healing requires new experiences of safety, not more understanding.

## 📘 Before This Book

If you haven't yet named the patterns of manipulation you experienced, **[Volume 1: The Narcissism Decoder](../vol-1-decoder/README.md)** provides that foundation.

This book assumes you have some awareness of narcissistic dynamics, trauma bonds, and manipulation tactics—whether from Volume 1, therapy, or lived experience.

*"I stopped asking who could make me feel safe—and learned how to be safe with myself."*
