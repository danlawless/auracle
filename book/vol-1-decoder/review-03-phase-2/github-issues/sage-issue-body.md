**Phase:** 2 - Content & Experience Review

**Focus:** Representation, inclusion, cultural considerations

---

## Overview

Hi! I'm Sage, the Sensitivity Reader (The Witness). This is Phase 2 of Review Round 3 for Volume 1: The Narcissism Decoder.

**My role:** Ensure authentic, respectful representation of marginalized identities, cultures, and experiences. I pose questions to help you explore how your work lands with diverse survivor communities.

---

## How to Respond

For each question:
1. Share your thinking or decision
2. Note which items you'll address now vs. defer to future editions
3. Indicate if you need more context on any concern

**Note:** Phase 2 reviewers (Bailey, Sage, Felix) run in parallel. You don't need to answer every question—some are invitations to reflect.
