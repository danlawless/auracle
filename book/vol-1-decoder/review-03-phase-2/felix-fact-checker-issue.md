**Suggested Sources:**

**The Question:** What is the source of this specific percentage?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Published research — provide citation: _______________
- [ ] B) Clinical observation from your practice — reframe as: "In my clinical experience, preemptive awareness significantly reduces their effectiveness"

- [ ] E) Remove percentage entirely

**Location:** Appendix A

**Current State:** Extensive international resources now covering 20+ countries.

**The Question:** Have all international hotline numbers been individually verified as current (particularly those beyond the English-speaking countries verified in Round 2)?

## Corrections Required Before Publication

### MUST FIX: Gloria Steinem Quote (2 locations)

**These corrections can be made without author input:**

**Location 1: README.md, line 227**

**Location 2: course/00-curriculum.md, line 181**
- Change: "— Gloria Steinem" → "— commonly attributed to Gloria Steinem"
