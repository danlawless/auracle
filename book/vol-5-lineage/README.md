## Volume 5: Breaking the Chain — Parenting After Trauma

> *A Guide for Those Ready to Give Their Children What They Never Received*

---

## ⚡ The Vision

This volume addresses the question every healed trauma survivor asks: *"How do I not pass this on?"*

Parenting is where sovereignty meets its greatest test. Your children will activate old wounds, trigger survival responses, and mirror back parts of yourself you thought were healed. This book teaches you to parent from presence, not from your own unmet needs.

**Core insight:** *"You don't have to be healed to be a good parent. You have to be healing."*
