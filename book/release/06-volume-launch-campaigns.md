# Volume 2 Launch Campaign: The Bridge

## Email Sequence

### Email 1: The Teaser (4 weeks before launch)

**Subject:** You asked for this...

**Body:**

When I released The Narcissism Decoder, I heard the same question over and over:

*"I can name the patterns now. But why can't I stop reacting?"*

You understood what happened. You could see the manipulation. You had the language.

And yet your body still responded as if nothing had changed.

That gap—between insight and embodiment—is where the real work lives.

It's why I wrote the second book.

**The Bridge: Learning Secure Attachment After Trauma** picks up where recognition ends. It's about healing at the nervous system level. About retraining your attachment patterns. About building relationships that regulate rather than activate.

It's coming soon.

If you want early access when it drops, just reply "BRIDGE" and I'll make sure you're first to know.

Talk soon,
[Your name]

P.S. — In the meantime, here's a preview of what we'll cover: [Link to teaser content on Substack]

### Email 2: The Excerpt (3 weeks before launch)

**Subject:** "What we call chemistry is often familiarity"

**Body:**

One of the most important chapters in The Bridge is about slow burns vs. fast burns.

Here's a preview:

---

*There's a reason unhealthy relationships often feel so intense.*

*And a reason healthy relationships can feel... boring.*

*For those who grew up in dysregulated environments:*
- *Intensity = love (that's what you knew)*
- *Anxiety = passion (that's how love felt)*
- *Quick bonding = safety (the faster you lock in, the safer you are)*

*Your nervous system seeks what it knows, not what it needs.*

*What we call "chemistry" is often familiarity.*

*What we call "boring" is often safety we haven't learned to trust yet.*

---

This reframe alone has changed how so many readers approach dating after trauma.

The full chapter includes:
- The Slow Burn Protocol (a phased approach to dating)
- How to distinguish real slow burns from avoidant distance
- Why your nervous system mistakes activation for attraction

The Bridge releases in [X] weeks.

# Volume 3 Launch Campaign: Sovereignty

## Email Sequence

### Email 1: The Teaser (4 weeks before launch)

**Subject:** What comes after healing?

**Body:**

You've done the work.

You can name the patterns. You understand your attachment style. You've practiced regulation.

And now something unexpected has emerged: space.

Space where urgency used to be. Neutrality where intensity once lived.

For some, this feels like freedom.

For others, it feels disorienting. Even empty.

*"Who am I when I stop shrinking?"*

That's the question the next book answers.

**Sovereignty** is about living from internal authority. Making decisions without outsourcing approval. Holding space without absorbing. Leading without performing.

It's not about becoming bigger or louder.

It's about learning to stay.

Coming soon. Reply "SOVEREIGNTY" if you want early access.

[Your name]

---

### Email 2: The Excerpt (3 weeks before launch)

**Subject:** "I can decide without urgency"

**Body:**

Here's something that surprised me about healing:

The hard part isn't learning to set boundaries.

The hard part is what happens *after* the boundaries are set.

The space. The quiet. The absence of chaos.

For those who grew up in activation, calm can feel like failure. Neutrality can feel like nothing.

Sovereignty teaches you to stand in that space.

Here's a preview from Chapter 8:

---

*"Every time you feel guilty for choosing yourself, you are encountering an old contract.*

*These contracts were never signed consciously. They were installed early, by people who needed you to be smaller so they could feel okay.*

*Ending the contract feels like betrayal.*

*But the contract was never fair.*

*You can renegotiate now."*

---

The full chapter includes:
- Identifying invisible emotional contracts
- The difference between guilt and wisdom
- How to separate without severing

Sovereignty releases in [X] weeks.

### Email 3: Launch Day

**Sovereignty: Living From Internal Authority** is now available.

→ [Get it on Gumroad] (includes Integration Guide + Daily Anchors)

**Who this book is for:**

Those who feel guilt after choosing themselves.

Those who feel anxious when no one else decides.

Those who mistake calm for emptiness.

Leaders who perform instead of leading.

Those ready to move from healing to living.

---

**What you'll learn:**

- Installing internal authority without outsourcing
- Holding emotional fields without absorbing them
- Leading through presence, not performance
- Sovereignty in partnership, family, and work
- Navigating others' dysregulation from a grounded place

---

**The core promise:**

By the end of this book, you will trust yourself without needing certainty.

You will make decisions from internal authority, not external approval.

You will stand without shrinking.

---

This is Volume 3 of the journey:
- Vol 1: See what's happening
- Vol 2: Heal from it
- **Vol 3: Stand in who you've become**

# Volume 4 Launch Campaign: Embodied Leadership

## Email Sequence

### Email 1: The Teaser (4 weeks before launch)

**Subject:** The final volume

**Body:**

This is it.

The fourth and final book in the Sovereignty Series.

**Embodied Leadership** is for those who have done the work:
- Named the patterns (Volume 1)
- Healed the wounds (Volume 2)
- Installed sovereignty (Volume 3)

And are now asking:

*"How do I live from this place?"*

This book is about embodiment.

Your energy field is trainable. Your presence already affects the room. The question is whether that power is coherent—or leaking, defending, performing.

This book teaches you to live from what you've built.

Topics include:
- Aura hygiene and field coherence
- Sexual energy as life force (trauma-informed approach)
- Erotic boundaries and clean intimacy
- Magnetism without manipulation
- The shadow of the healer

Content notice: This volume includes material about sexuality, addressed as life force rather than performance. The approach is nervous-system-first and sovereignty-centered.

Reply "EMBODIED" if you want early access.

[Your name]

---

### Email 2: The Excerpt (3 weeks before launch)

**Subject:** "Your aura is not mystical first—it is physiological first"

**Body:**

One of the chapters I'm most proud of is about the energy field.

Not as something mystical. As something real.

Here's a preview:

---

*"The field around you is an extension of your nervous system state.*

*When you regulate internally, you radiate externally.*

*When you're coherent, others feel it.*

*This isn't magic. It's physiology.*

*Heart rate variability, vagal tone, breathing patterns—all of these create measurable electromagnetic fields that extend beyond your skin.*

*Your 'vibe' is real. And it's trainable."*

---

The full chapter includes:
- Daily aura hygiene practices
- How to clear what isn't yours
- The nervous system as the aura's engine

Embodied Leadership releases in [X] weeks.

### Email 3: Content Notice (1 week before launch)

**Subject:** A note about Volume 4

**Body:**

Embodied Leadership launches next week.

Before it does, I want to share something important.

This volume includes significant material about sexuality.

Not as titillation. Not as technique. As life force.

For those who have experienced sexual trauma or had sexuality used as a control mechanism, this material may be activating. I've written it with care—nervous-system-first, sovereignty-centered, with content notices where needed.

The core insight:

**Sexuality heals when it no longer has to regulate fear.**

If you're ready for this material, it's some of the most important in the series.

If you're not ready yet, Volume 3 (Sovereignty) stands complete on its own.

There's no rush. The book will be here when you're ready.

[Your name]

P.S. — Appendix E includes a Reader Self-Check for sexuality, safety, and the nervous system. Start there if you're unsure.

There is no Volume 5.

The work becomes your life.

---

**What's in this final volume:**

---

**The core promise:**
