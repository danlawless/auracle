# Chapter 10: Referral — When to Pass the Baton

## The Skill of Knowing Your Limits

---

There is a moment in every helper's journey when they face someone whose needs exceed their capacity.

Maybe it's the client whose depression is deeper than your coaching can reach. The friend whose suicidal ideation requires clinical intervention. The community member whose trauma history reveals itself as something far beyond peer support.

**This moment is a test.**

Not of your skill—but of your ego.

The helper who cannot refer is not protecting the person in front of them. They are protecting their own image of themselves as the one who heals. This is the shadow of the healer dressed as devotion.

Knowing when to pass the baton is not failure. It is the highest expression of ethical helping.

## Field Note (Before): The Coach Who Couldn't Let Go

Her client was struggling. Really struggling.

What had started as career coaching had revealed a history of childhood abuse, severe depression, and patterns that ran far deeper than any career question.

She knew, somewhere in her body, that this needed more than she could offer. But she also knew the client trusted her. Had chosen her. Didn't want to start over with someone new.

So she kept going. Stretched her sessions longer. Did extra research on trauma. Told herself she could learn enough to meet this.

Three months later, the client's crisis escalated. An ER visit. A near-miss.

In the aftermath, the client said: "I wish you had told me I needed more help. I thought because you kept seeing me, I was okay."

*Her need to be enough had cost them both.*

---

## Field Note (After): The Coach Who Made the Call

Different coach. Similar crossroads.

Her client's material was going deeper than their container could hold. She could feel it—the weight was beyond her scope.

She didn't wait for crisis. She named it:

"I want to talk about something important. I'm noticing that what's coming up for you goes deeper than what I'm trained to hold. I think you'd really benefit from working with a trauma therapist—someone who has specialized tools for this. I can help you find the right person, and I can stay in your corner while you do that work. What I can't do is be the right container for what's emerging. And I care about you too much to pretend otherwise."

The client was scared. And also relieved.

"You're not abandoning me?"

"I'm making sure you get what you actually need. That's the opposite of abandonment."

*The referral wasn't rejection. It was care.*

---

## Why Referral Is So Hard

If referral is just "connecting someone with appropriate care," why does it feel so loaded?

Because referral touches our deepest fears as helpers:

**Fear of inadequacy.** "If I were good enough, I could handle this."

**Fear of abandonment projection.** "They'll feel rejected. Like I'm giving up on them."

**Fear of losing connection.** "Once they go to someone else, they won't need me."

**Fear of being wrong.** "What if I'm overreacting? What if they're fine?"

**Fear of being replaceable.** "If someone else can help them, what was I even doing?"

**The shadow wants you to be everything.** Referral requires you to accept that you are not—and never will be.

---

## The Neuroscience of Scope

Your nervous system was trained in a context.

If you're a peer supporter, your nervous system learned to hold peer-level distress. If you're a coach, it learned to hold growth-oriented challenge. If you're a therapist, it learned to hold clinical-level material.

**When material exceeds your training, your nervous system knows—even if your ego doesn't.**

Signs your system is recognizing out-of-scope material:

- Persistent unease about a particular client
- Dreaming about their situation
- Dreading sessions
- Feeling pulled in over your head
- Over-preparing, over-researching
- Seeking extra supervision or consultation
- Relief when they cancel
- Vigilance you can't shake after sessions

These are not signs of weakness. They are signals from a system that knows its edges. Listen to them.

## The Scope Matrix

Different helpers have different scopes. Referral is about knowing yours.

| Helper Type | In Scope | Usually Out of Scope |
|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Peer Supporter** | Shared experience, emotional support, resource navigation, lived-experience guidance | Clinical disorders, crisis intervention, active suicidality, complex trauma |
| **Life Coach** | Goals, transitions, mindset, accountability, life design | Mental health diagnoses, trauma processing, suicidal ideation, substance dependence |
| **Trauma-Informed Coach** | Nervous system education, resilience building, pattern recognition | Deep trauma processing, PTSD treatment, dissociative disorders |
| **Licensed Therapist** | Mental health treatment, trauma processing, clinical disorders | Medication management, medical conditions, specialized populations outside training |
| **Specialized Therapist** | Deep work in specialization (trauma, eating disorders, etc.) | Outside specialization, medical needs, conditions requiring higher care |
| **Psychiatrist** | Medication evaluation and management, severe mental illness | Long-term talk therapy, coaching-style work |

**Know your lane.** Not as limitation—as clarity.

## The Referral Indicators

### Immediate Referral Needed

These situations require you to stop and refer—now:

| Indicator | Why It's Urgent |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Active suicidal ideation with plan** | Life safety—this needs clinical response |
| **Active homicidal ideation** | Safety for them and others |
| **Psychotic symptoms** | Needs psychiatric evaluation |
| **Severe self-harm** | Medical and psychiatric needs |
| **Active eating disorder symptoms** | Medical complications possible |
| **Substance crisis** | Specialized intervention required |
| **Domestic violence crisis** | Safety planning needs expertise |
| **Child abuse disclosure** | Mandatory reporting likely |

If you encounter these, your job is connection to appropriate resources, not continued support.

### Referral Strongly Recommended

These situations suggest your work should be supplemented or transferred:

| Indicator | What It Suggests |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Symptoms worsening despite your work** | The intervention isn't matching the need |
| **Dissociation during sessions** | Trauma work needed with specialized training |
| **Unable to function in daily life** | Higher level of care needed |
| **Your expertise is exceeded** | Specific training required (addiction, eating disorders, etc.) |
| **You're dreading sessions** | Your system knows something your ego doesn't |
| **They need medication evaluation** | You can't provide this; they need someone who can |
| **Legal or forensic implications** | Specialized expertise required |
| **The relationship isn't helping** | Sometimes the fit is wrong, even if no one did anything wrong |

### Referral Worth Considering

These situations invite reflection:

| Indicator | What to Consider |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Material keeps exceeding your container** | Is this a scope issue or a support issue? |
| **You're working harder than they are** | Is this helping or enabling? |
| **Your own material is activated** | Can you stay clean, or do you need to step back? |
| **You're the only support** | Diversification is healthy |
| **The work has stalled** | Fresh perspective might help |
| **They've outgrown what you offer** | Success looks like leaving |

## Field Note: The Referral That Saved a Life

He was a coach who specialized in helping survivors rebuild their careers after trauma.

One client mentioned suicidal thoughts. Casually. Almost offhand.

He didn't let it pass. He didn't panic. He followed the protocol he'd trained for.

"I hear you. I'm glad you told me. I need to ask some more questions, because this is something I take seriously."

He assessed. The ideation was passive but present. There was no plan. But there was hopelessness.

"What you're describing is really important, and it's beyond what I can hold as a coach. I want to help you get connected with a therapist who specializes in this—someone who can be there in a way I'm not trained to be. Can we do that together right now?"

She resisted. She didn't want to start over. She didn't want to feel broken.

"You're not broken. You're carrying more than one person should hold. A therapist won't make you start over—they'll add to your support. I'm not going anywhere. I just need you to have someone who can catch what I can't."

She called the therapist that week. Within a month, she was stabilized. Within six months, she was back in coaching—and alive.

*The referral wasn't rejection. It was rescue.*

---

## How to Make a Referral

### Step 1: Name It Directly

Don't hedge. Don't apologize. Name what you're seeing.

"I'm noticing that what we're working with is going beyond what I can hold as a [coach/peer supporter/etc.]."

"This is important enough that I think you need specialized support."

"I want to make sure you're getting care that matches what you're dealing with."

### Step 2: Validate Their Experience

They may feel scared, rejected, or ashamed. Meet that.

"This isn't because something is wrong with you. It's because what you're carrying is significant."

"I know starting with someone new feels hard. Your feelings about that make sense."

"This is me taking you seriously, not dismissing you."

### Step 3: Offer a Bridge

Don't just drop them. Build a bridge.

**Options:**
- "I have a few people I can recommend. Want me to share their information?"
- "Would it help if I stayed on while you get connected?"
- "I can email an introduction if that would make it easier."
- "Let's talk next week to see how the search is going."

### Step 4: Be Clear About Your Role Going Forward

Will you continue seeing them? In what capacity? Be explicit.

"I can still be in your corner for the career stuff while you work with a therapist on the deeper material."

"I think it makes sense for me to step back while you work with someone more suited to this."

"Once you're stabilized, we can revisit whether coaching makes sense again."

### Step 5: Follow Up

Referral doesn't end with a name and number. Check in.

"How did the first session go?"

"Did you find someone who felt like a fit?"

"Is there anything else you need to get connected?"

## Referral Language That Works

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "I can't help you with this." | "This needs specialized care that goes beyond what I offer." |
| "You're too complicated for me." | "What you're dealing with deserves someone with specific training for this." |
| "I'm not qualified." | "I want to make sure you're getting the right kind of support." |
| "I have to refer you out." | "I think the best thing I can do for you is connect you with someone who specializes in this." |
| "I'm firing you as a client." | "I care about you enough to make sure you get what you actually need." |

## The Ego Trap: Being Everything

There is a version of the helper who cannot refer. Not because they've assessed and decided against it—but because their ego won't allow it.

**Signs you're in this trap:**

- Telling yourself you're "almost trained enough" to handle it
- Researching frantically to fill gaps rather than referring
- Believing the relationship is more important than appropriate care
- Fearing that referring makes you look inadequate
- Convincing yourself that they'd fall through the cracks with anyone else
- Making exceptions for "just this one client"

**The honest question:** Is my reluctance to refer about them—or about me?

---

## Building Your Referral Network

You cannot refer if you don't know where to send people. Build your network before you need it.

### Categories to Have Covered:

- **Licensed therapists** (general and specialized: trauma, addiction, eating disorders, etc.)
- **Psychiatrists** (for medication evaluation)
- **Crisis resources** (hotlines, crisis centers, ER protocols)
- **Support groups** (12-step, peer support, specific conditions)
- **Sliding-scale options** (for clients without resources)
- **Specialists** (EMDR, somatic, DBT, etc.)
- **Complementary practitioners** (bodywork, nutrition, etc.—if relevant)

### How to Build It:

1. **Ask colleagues.** Who do they refer to? Who do they trust?
2. **Attend trainings.** Meet people whose work you respect.
3. **Build relationships.** Have coffee with potential referral partners.
4. **Test the waters.** Send a few clients before you're desperate.
5. **Keep notes.** Track who works well for what.
6. **Update regularly.** People move, retire, change focus.

## What to Do in Crisis

If someone is in immediate danger:

### If You're In Session:

1. **Stay calm.** Your regulation is their lifeline right now.
2. **Assess.** "Are you thinking of hurting yourself? Do you have a plan? Do you have access to means?"
3. **Do not leave them alone.** Virtually or physically.
4. **Connect to crisis resources.** 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline), local crisis line, ER.
5. **Document.** Time, what was said, what you did.

### If They Disclose and You're Ending Session:

1. **Do not end session.** Extend until they're safe or connected.
2. **Create safety plan together.** What will they do tonight? Who will they call?
3. **Get commitment.** "Can you agree to call me or a crisis line before you do anything?"
4. **Follow up.** Check in within 24 hours.

### Know Your Legal Requirements:

If you're a mandated reporter, know your state/country's requirements for:
- Suicidal ideation
- Homicidal ideation
- Child abuse
- Elder abuse
- Vulnerable adult abuse

When in doubt, consult. Err on the side of safety.

## Field Note: The Referral That Wasn't Rejected

She'd been dreading this conversation.

Her client was clearly struggling with addiction—something she wasn't trained to treat. But their relationship was strong. The work was good, outside of this one issue.

She expected resistance. She expected abandonment wounds to flare.

Instead, her client said: "Honestly? I was wondering when you'd say something. I knew this was beyond what we were doing. I just didn't want to be the one to name it."

The referral went smoothly. An addiction specialist joined the team. The coaching continued—cleaner, more focused.

*Sometimes they're waiting for permission.*

---

## When Referral Is Refused

Sometimes you make the referral and they decline.

**If it's not urgent:**
- Respect their autonomy
- Document that you recommended and they declined
- Revisit periodically
- Stay within your scope regardless

**If it is urgent:**
- Be more direct about your concerns
- Explain the risks of not getting care
- If there's imminent danger, crisis protocols apply regardless of their consent
- Consult with supervisors or colleagues
- Document everything

**You cannot force care** (in most situations). But you can be clear about what you're willing to offer within your scope.

---

## The Long-Term Gift

The client you refer out often comes back.

Not because the referral failed—but because they're now ready for what you offer. They've done the deep work. They're stabilized. They're ready for coaching, growth, forward movement.

**The referral was the bridge.**

Or they don't come back. Because they're better. Because they've moved on. Because your job was to connect them to what they needed—and you did.

Either way, the referral was the gift.

---

## A Practice: The Scope Inventory

For each person you're currently working with:

1. **What is the primary issue we're addressing?**
2. **Is this within my scope of practice/training?**
3. **Are there secondary issues that might be outside my scope?**
4. **Have I noticed any warning signs that suggest referral?**
5. **If I were to refer, who would I refer to?**

Do this monthly. Don't wait for crisis.

---

## A Practice: The Referral Script

Write out your referral script before you need it. Practice it.

**Example:**

"I want to share something important. I've been noticing that what we're working with is going beyond what I'm trained to hold. I think you'd really benefit from working with [a therapist/a specialist/someone with specific training in X]. This isn't because I'm giving up on you—it's because I care about you enough to make sure you get the right support. I can help you find someone, and I can stay in your corner [in this capacity]. What comes up for you when I say that?"

Make it yours. Say it out loud. Get comfortable with it.

---

## A Practice: The Referral Network Audit

Answer these questions:

1. **Do I have referrals for crisis situations?** (Numbers saved, not just Googled.)
2. **Do I have referrals for common needs?** (Therapy, psychiatry, addiction, etc.)
3. **Do I have sliding-scale options for clients without resources?**
4. **Have I personally connected with my referrals?** (Or are they just names?)
5. **When did I last update my list?**

Fill gaps before you need to use them.

---

## The Integration

Your job as a helper is not to be everything.

Your job is to be the right thing—when you're the right thing. And to connect to the right thing when you're not.

Referral is not failure. It is precision. It is humility. It is the acknowledgment that this person's healing matters more than your ego's need to be the healer.

The helper who cannot refer has mistaken devotion for competence.

The helper who refers well has mastered both.
