## The Journey to Healing

Jae's path to becoming a guide for others began with her own descent into—and emergence from—the confusion of narcissistic abuse.

For years, she lived in relationships and family dynamics that systematically eroded her trust in herself. The sensitivity that would later become her greatest gift was first labeled a liability: "too emotional," "too intense," "making things up." Like many survivors, she learned to doubt her own perception before she learned to trust it.

Her awakening came not through sudden revelation but through the slow, painful process of recognizing patterns she had normalized. The checking disguised as care. The concern that felt like surveillance. The love that came with conditions she could never quite meet. Once she saw the architecture of control, she couldn't unsee it.

The years that followed were devoted to understanding: first her own experience, then the universal patterns beneath it. She studied psychology, neuroscience, and trauma. She learned somatic practices and energy work. She sat with hundreds of people carrying the same wounds she had carried—and discovered that healing was not only possible but transformative.

## The Work

Jae founded **The Auracle** as a space where spirituality meets practical healing. Her work combines:

- **Aura Reading & Energy Work** — Helping clients understand their energetic patterns and the imprints left by past relationships
- **Rose Meditation** — A signature practice for grounding, self-connection, and nervous system regulation
- **Narcissistic Abuse Recovery** — Guiding survivors through recognition, understanding, and liberation
- **Spiritual Guidance** — Supporting clients in their broader spiritual journey and soul development

Her approach is distinctive: she refuses to separate the spiritual from the psychological, the energetic from the practical. Healing happens in the body as much as the mind, in the energy field as much as the biography.

## The Philosophy

At the heart of Jae's work is a simple belief:

**Your sensitivity is not your weakness. It's your superpower.**

The same capacity that made you vulnerable to manipulation—your empathy, your attunement, your willingness to see the best in others—is the capacity that will guide you toward healing and help you build the relationships you deserve.

She believes that:

- **Naming patterns creates power.** What you can identify, you can address.
- **The body knows before the mind.** Learning to trust somatic signals is essential.
- **Healing is possible.** No matter how deep the wound, recovery is within reach.
- **Your experience matters.** What happened to you was real, and you deserve validation.
- **Sensitivity is sacred.** It's a gift to be protected, not a flaw to be fixed.

## The Book

*The Narcissism Decoder* represents the distillation of everything Jae has learned—from her own journey, from years of working with clients, from studying the research, and from listening to the wisdom of survivor communities.

She wrote it for the person she was years ago: confused, self-doubting, desperately needing someone to explain what was happening. She wrote it for everyone who has been told they were "too sensitive" when they were actually too perceptive. She wrote it as the guide she wished she had found.

Her hope is that these pages bring clarity to your confusion, language to your experience, and—ultimately—freedom from the patterns that have held you.
