## The Self-Soothing → Regulation Spectrum

Use this chart to normalize where you are without shame and locate what's next — gently.

---

### LEFT: REACTIVE SOOTHING

*(Not wrong. Often necessary.)*

- Automatic, numbing
- Time-blind (hours pass)
- Relief followed by guilt
- Chosen to stop discomfort fast
- Nervous system says: *"I need this to survive."*

**Examples:** Binge-watching, scrolling, smoking to "take the edge off," zoning out

---

### MIDDLE: CONSCIOUS SOOTHING

*(Transition phase — powerful and protective.)*

- Chosen intentionally
- Body awareness present
- Soft limits instead of hard rules
- Relief without collapse
- Nervous system says: *"I need rest, not escape."*

**Examples:** Watching one episode with awareness, mindful cannabis use, music + rest

---

### RIGHT: EMBODIED REGULATION

*(This emerges — it is not forced.)*

- Relief comes from presence
- No urgency to escape
- Desire and rest coexist
- Nervous system says: *"I am safe here."*

**Examples:** Walking, breath, creativity, attuned connection, stillness

---

### KEY REFRAME

**You do not jump from left to right. You cross through the middle.**

## Relief vs. Regulation: A Gentle Inquiry

### 4. How does my body feel after I soothe?

*(Check what's true.)*

- [ ] Relieved
- [ ] Ashamed
- [ ] Neutral
- [ ] Rested

### 5. One experiment this week

Choose one:

- [ ] Pause for 60 seconds before soothing
- [ ] Choose soothing consciously
- [ ] Add embodiment (stretch, breath, water)
- [ ] Stop gently instead of abruptly

---

### Integration Line (Write by hand):

> *"I can offer relief without abandoning myself."*
