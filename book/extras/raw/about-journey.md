## About Me

I'm a creative at heart—an artist, event producer (Good Ones, Predictive Index), singer, energy healer, therapist, yogi, and sales aficionado. My diverse career spans personal training, yoga instruction, psychotherapy, event production, and sales. Each experience has brought me closer to my purpose: helping others connect to their higher selves, heal, and embody their true essence.

I am deeply grounded in my soul work, and through my spiritual journey, I now seek to help others uncover their unique soul path.

## My Journey Highlights

### The Traditional Path

I hold a **Master of Science in Mental Health Counseling** and have spent years working in the traditional field of talk therapy. This grounding in psychology has provided me with deep insights into the human psyche and emotional healing, forming the foundation for my holistic approach.

### The Spiritual Awakening

My spiritual journey truly began with a powerful **Kundalini awakening**, guided by my coach **Peggy Butkus** and astrologer **Shira Beth Brenner**. Through this work, I embraced deep transformation, which opened the door to new levels of consciousness and healing.

**Key Transformative Moments:**

**The Death & Rebirth**
- **Reiki I initiation** at Maha Rose, just two weeks before my father passed
- This allowed me to open my clairvoyance and communicate with him beyond the physical realm
- I experienced my first psychic vision the night he crossed over

**The Quest**
- Over three years of global travel in search of spiritual community, healing, and self-discovery
- A journey that took me across continents and into the depths of my soul

## Key Transformative Locations

### Cyprus: The Grief Portal
After my father's passing, I began my grief writing process in Cyprus. I wrote over 200 pages detailing my communication with him through **clairaudience** and the deep healing that unfolded as a result. This was where I learned to truly listen beyond the veil.

### Greece: The Soul's Blueprint
I immersed myself in the study of astrology with **Kaypacha**, founder of Astrology for the Soul, uncovering my soul's blueprint and understanding my cosmic purpose.

### Nicaragua: Breaking Free
I lived here for about a year, breaking free from societal constraints and US cultural conditioning. I connected with transformative communities including:
- **Arnold Poncon**, founder of WeGo Nicaragua
- **Kelly Krezek** and **Joe McVeen**, founders of New Earth Development
- **Luke Jensen**, founder of Vibe Up

This was where I learned to think freely and reconnect with natural rhythms.

### Costa Rica & Mexico: Finding My Path

The turning point came when I met **Diego Dosal Stieglitz**, visionary spiritual leader and founder of Zunya, Costa Rica.

Diego introduced me to **Angelina Ataide** (affectionately known as Angel), the founder of **Escola da Aura**. In that moment, my path became crystal clear. I had found my spiritual home and the modality that would become my life's work.

I also experienced powerful **Transitions** events in Mexico with Diego—immersive experiences that facilitated profound shadow work and transformation.

## The Brutal Honesty: From Feardom to Freedom

My journey hasn't always been easy. Like many, I had to face my shadow self—a process I approached through the lens of **Jungian shadow work**.

### What I Had to Release:
- Passive-aggressive behavior patterns
- Negativity and blame
- Criticism and worst-case-scenario thinking
- The need for external validation
- Allowing myself to shrink in abusive and narcissistic relationships
- Years of depression and anxiety
- My mortally wounded self-esteem

### The Shadow Work Process:

**Transitions 1: Releasing the Need for Approval**
Through deep Jungian shadow work, I said goodbye to the need for external validation and love from anyone but myself. I learned that I am enough, exactly as I am.

**Transitions 2: Embracing the Divine Feminine**
I released my toxic female self—the parts shaped by trauma, societal conditioning, and fear—and embraced the healthy, divine feminine within me.

This work was brutally honest. I had to own my part in allowing toxic dynamics to continue. I had to acknowledge the ways I had been passive in abusive situations and group dynamics. But through this work, I reclaimed my self-worth and found the courage to embrace the spiritual community I was destined to create.

## The Body, Mind, and Spirit Integration Pathway

### Advanced Training & Certifications

Meeting **Angelina Ataide**, founder of Escola da Aura, saved my spirit. In 2025, this journey crystallized into the founding of the **International School of Aura and Dreams, Rose OS**.

## Living in Community

Today, I'm living my dream in **Costa Rica**, on a hill surrounded by lemon trees. I share this sacred space with my partner **Daniel** (our tech wizard) and our friends, the howler monkeys.

Living in community starts with an open heart, and I'm grateful every day for the soul family that surrounds me.

### Transformative Events

Together, Diego (coach), Karlita (chef), Daniel (tech), and I host transformative soul events at Zunya, Costa Rica. These experiences combine energy healing, immersive meditation, aura readings, gourmet cuisine, and cutting-edge technology to create life-changing experiences.

The supreme pleasure of hosting—offering deep immersive meditation, holding space, and providing aura readings—has become my sacred work. We've hosted events in Nicaragua, Mexico, Morocco, Portugal, and Costa Rica.
