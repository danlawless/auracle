# Appendix C: Signs of Financial Abuse

## Recognizing Economic Control Disguised as Care, Concern, or Competence

---

Financial abuse is one of the most common—and most hidden—forms of intimate partner abuse. Studies suggest that 94-99% of domestic violence cases involve some form of financial abuse.

Yet it remains invisible for a reason: money is private, control can look like help, and abusers often convince their partners that the financial arrangement is normal, necessary, or for their own good.

This appendix helps you name what may have happened to you—or what may be happening now.

**A note before you begin:** Reading this may be activating. You may recognize patterns you didn't have words for. You may feel grief, anger, shame, or relief. All of these are valid. Go slowly. This is about recognition, not re-traumatization.

## What Is Financial Abuse?

Financial abuse is a pattern of behaviors that control a partner's ability to acquire, use, and maintain financial resources.

It exists on a spectrum from subtle to severe:

| Subtle | Moderate | Severe |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Monitoring spending | Controlling all money | Forcing debt in your name |
| Criticizing purchases | Requiring permission to spend | Stealing your identity |
| "Helpfully" managing money | Limiting access to accounts | Destroying your credit |
| Creating guilt about expenses | Sabotaging employment | Complete financial dependence |

**The common thread:** One partner has power over the other's financial life.

---

## Why It's So Hard to See

Financial abuse is often invisible because:

1. **Money is private.** We don't discuss finances, so there's no comparison point.

2. **Cultural norms cover it.** "The man handles money" or "I'm just bad with money" normalize control.

3. **It looks like care.** "I'm protecting you from stress" sounds loving.

4. **It happens gradually.** The frog in boiling water doesn't notice the temperature rising.

5. **Shame keeps it hidden.** Financial struggles feel like personal failure.

6. **It creates dependency.** By the time you see it, you may feel unable to leave.

## The Four Categories of Financial Abuse

### 1. Control and Restriction

**What it looks like:**

| Behavior | How It Sounds | What It Really Is |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Giving an allowance | "Here's your spending money for the week" | Treating an adult partner like a child |
| Requiring receipts | "Just show me where the money goes" | Surveillance disguised as accountability |
| Limiting access to accounts | "You don't need to worry about that" | Keeping you dependent and uninformed |
| Making you ask for money | "Just tell me what you need" | Creating a parent-child dynamic |
| Controlling large purchases | "We should discuss this first" (every time) | Maintaining veto power over your choices |
| Time-limiting access | "I'll transfer money when I can" | Making you wait and beg |

**The pattern:** Your financial life requires their permission.

**What you might feel:**
- Like a child asking for allowance
- Guilty about spending anything
- Unable to make independent purchases
- Afraid to buy things you need

---

### 2. Exploitation and Theft

**What it looks like:**

| Behavior | How It Sounds | What It Really Is |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Using your credit | "Just put it on your card—I'll pay it back" | Destroying your credit while preserving theirs |
| Taking your earnings | "We share everything" (but only yours) | Theft of your labor |
| Forging your signature | "I signed for you—it's easier" | Fraud |
| Opening accounts in your name | "It's for the family" | Identity theft |
| Stealing inheritance/gifts | "That money is ours now" | Taking what was given to you |
| Not paying agreed expenses | "I forgot" / "Money's tight" | Forcing you to cover their obligations |
| Claiming your assets | "What's yours is mine" | Entitlement to your property |

**The pattern:** They benefit financially at your expense.

**What you might feel:**
- Confused about what's fair
- Responsible for their debts
- Guilty for questioning "sharing"
- Trapped by obligations you didn't choose

---

### 3. Employment Sabotage

**What it looks like:**

| Behavior | How It Sounds | What It Really Is |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Discouraging work | "You don't need to work" | Creating dependence |
| Making you late/absent | "I need you here" / creates crises | Jeopardizing your job |
| Calling/showing up at work | "I was worried about you" | Surveillance and embarrassment |
| Refusing childcare support | "Kids need their mother" | Making work impossible |
| Demanding you quit | "Your job is affecting our family" | Eliminating your income |
| Belittling your career | "That's not a real job" | Undermining your confidence |
| Taking your paychecks | "I'll deposit it for us" | Intercepting your income |
| Controlling transportation | "I need the car today" (always) | Limiting your ability to work |

**The pattern:** They undermine your ability to earn or keep your own income.

**What you might feel:**
- Torn between relationship and career
- Embarrassed at work
- Unable to succeed professionally
- Like your work doesn't matter

---

### 4. Economic Coercion

**What it looks like:**

| Behavior | How It Sounds | What It Really Is |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Threatening financial ruin | "You'll have nothing without me" | Using fear to maintain control |
| Weaponizing divorce | "I'll take everything" | Threats to discourage leaving |
| Demanding repayment | "After everything I've done for you" | Creating false debt |
| Conditional support | "I'll pay if you [do what I want]" | Strings attached to money |
| Public financial humiliation | "She can't manage money" | Damaging your reputation |
| Post-separation control | "I'll reduce support if you date" | Continuing control after leaving |
| Litigation as abuse | Filing endless motions | Draining your resources through court |

**The pattern:** Money is used as punishment, threat, or leverage.

**What you might feel:**
- Terrified of financial consequences
- Trapped in the relationship
- Believing you can't survive alone
- Controlled even after separation

## Red Flags: Relationship Stages

### Early Relationship Red Flags

Watch for these patterns in new relationships:

| Red Flag | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Financial intensity | Expensive gifts early, paying for everything, lavish gestures |
| Money criticism | Comments about your spending, job, or finances |
| Quick merging | Pressure to combine finances, move in, or share accounts |
| Financial savior | "Let me take care of you" when you didn't ask |
| Debt disclosure pressure | Wanting to know all your financial details quickly |
| Employment opinions | Strong views about whether/where you should work |

**Note:** Some of these can exist in healthy relationships. The difference is *pattern* and *control*—do they respect your choices, or subtly push their preferences?

---

### Established Relationship Red Flags

In longer relationships, notice:

| Red Flag | Questions to Ask Yourself |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Information asymmetry | Do I know where our money is? Do I have full access? |
| Decision exclusion | Am I consulted on major financial decisions? |
| Earned income control | Does my income go into an account I control? |
| Spending freedom | Can I spend on myself without guilt or permission? |
| Financial secrets | Is my partner hiding money, debt, or spending? |
| Economic threats | Am I afraid of financial consequences for disagreeing? |
| Work interference | Is my career supported or sabotaged? |

---

### Post-Separation Red Flags

Financial abuse often continues or intensifies after leaving:

| Red Flag | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Support withholding | Late/missing child support or alimony |
| Litigation abuse | Endless court filings to drain resources |
| Credit sabotage | Running up joint accounts, damaging shared credit |
| Hidden assets | Concealing money during divorce proceedings |
| Children as leverage | "I won't pay unless you [do what I want]" |
| New debt discovery | Finding out about debts taken in your name |
| Reputation destruction | Telling others you're "after their money" |

---

## Self-Assessment: Financial Abuse Indicators

Rate how often each statement was true in your relationship:
(0 = Never, 1 = Sometimes, 2 = Often, 3 = Always)

### Control

| | Statement | Score |
|-|-----------|-------|
| | I needed permission or approval to spend money | |
| | I didn't have access to our accounts or financial information | |
| | I was given an allowance rather than having equal access | |
| | My spending was monitored, questioned, or criticized | |
| | I felt like I was not allowed to have financial opinions | |

### Exploitation

| | Statement | Score |
|-|-----------|-------|
| | My money or property was taken without real consent | |
| | Debt was incurred in my name without my knowledge/agreement | |
| | I paid for things that were supposed to be shared | |
| | My partner's needs were funded while mine weren't | |
| | I didn't know where our money was actually going | |

### Employment

| | Statement | Score |
|-|-----------|-------|
| | My work was discouraged, sabotaged, or mocked | |
| | Crises often coincided with important work events | |
| | I was pressured to quit or reduce my work | |
| | My ability to work was limited by childcare, transportation, or other factors they controlled | |
| | My career achievements were minimized or ignored | |

### Coercion

| | Statement | Score |
|-|-----------|-------|
| | I was threatened with financial consequences for disagreeing | |
| | I was told I couldn't survive without them | |
| | Money was used as reward or punishment | |
| | I was afraid to leave because of financial concerns | |
| | After separation, money has been used to control me | |

**Scoring:**

| Total Score | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| 0-10 | Low indicators (some may still be significant) |
| 11-25 | Moderate indicators of financial abuse |
| 26-40 | Significant indicators of financial abuse |
| 41-60 | Severe indicators of financial abuse |

**Note:** Even a few "often" or "always" responses can indicate abuse. This isn't a diagnostic tool—it's a recognition tool.

## "But It Was..."

Financial abuse is often rationalized. Here are common "explanations" and the reality:

### "They're just better with money"

**Reality check:** Being good with money doesn't require controlling another adult's access to it. Financial competence can include teaching, sharing, and empowering—not hoarding information and control.

### "We agreed I would stay home"

**Reality check:** Staying home is a choice. Having no access to family money, no say in finances, and no financial independence isn't an agreement—it's dependence. One partner contributing domestic labor should still have equal financial access and voice.

### "They worked hard for that money"

**Reality check:** So did you—whether through paid work, domestic labor, emotional labor, or sacrificing your own career. Partnership means shared resources, not one person's ownership.

### "I'm bad with money"

**Reality check:** Were you "bad with money" before this relationship? Or did you become "bad with money" in a context of criticism, control, and undermined confidence? Often this belief was installed by the abuser.

### "They were protecting me from stress"

**Reality check:** Information isn't stress—it's agency. Protection that requires ignorance isn't protection. Adults deserve to understand their own financial situation.

### "It's cultural"

**Reality check:** Cultural norms about gender and money vary. But control, deception, and exploitation aren't cultural values—they're abuse patterns using culture as cover.

---

## The Nervous System Impact of Financial Abuse

Financial abuse doesn't just affect your bank account—it affects your nervous system.

### What Gets Installed

| Experience | Nervous System Response |
|------------|------------------------|
| Constant monitoring | Hypervigilance around spending |
| Permission-seeking | Freeze response with financial decisions |
| Scarcity creation | Activated scarcity even with resources |
| Criticism and shame | Shame spiral around any purchase |
| Threats about money | Fear response to financial conversations |
| Dependence | Belief that you can't manage money |

### What It Looks Like Now

Even after leaving, you may experience:

- **Anxiety** about checking bank balances
- **Paralysis** around financial decisions
- **Guilt** when buying anything for yourself
- **Hoarding** behaviors (unable to spend, even on needs)
- **Compulsive spending** (finally can, so overdoing it)
- **Avoidance** of anything money-related
- **Distrust** of anyone's financial guidance

These responses are not character flaws. They're adaptations to financial trauma.

## Financial Abuse vs. Financial Disagreement

Not all money conflict is abuse. Here's the difference:

| Healthy Disagreement | Financial Abuse |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Both partners have voice | One partner dominates |
| Information is shared | Information is controlled or hidden |
| Decisions are made together | Decisions are made unilaterally |
| Both have access to money | Access is restricted or controlled |
| Disagreements are resolved | Control is maintained through conflict |
| Both feel respected | One feels controlled or afraid |
| Mistakes are learning | Mistakes are ammunition |
| Support is unconditional | Support has strings attached |

**Key distinction:** Disagreement involves two equals working through difference. Abuse involves one person maintaining power over another.

## What to Do If You Recognize These Patterns

### If You're Currently in This Situation

**Immediate steps (when safe):**
1. Begin documenting patterns (dates, incidents, impacts)
2. Research your legal rights

**Safety note:** Financial abuse often co-occurs with other abuse. If you're in danger, your safety comes first.

### If You've Left

**Healing steps:**
1. Assess the full financial picture (Appendix A)
2. Work with a trauma-informed financial professional if possible
3. Begin nervous system repair around money
4. Join support groups for survivors
5. Consider therapy for financial trauma

### If You're Supporting Someone

## Documentation Guide

If you're experiencing financial abuse, document:

### What to Document

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Access restrictions | Denied access to accounts, removed from accounts |
| Spending control | Required receipts, criticized purchases, allowance |
| Employment interference | Specific incidents, dates, impacts on your job |
| Exploitation | Debt in your name, stolen money, forged signatures |
| Threats | Specific statements about financial consequences |
| Hidden assets | Evidence of money or accounts you didn't know about |

### How to Document

- Keep records somewhere they can't access (cloud, trusted person)
- Note dates, times, specifics
- Save texts, emails, voicemails
- Take photos of documents
- Keep copies of financial statements
- Write down incidents as they happen

**Safety warning:** If documenting could put you in danger, your safety is more important than documentation.

## Integration

Financial abuse is real. It is recognized by law (in most jurisdictions). It has lasting impacts. And it is not your fault.

Whatever you're feeling as you read this—grief for lost years, anger at what was done, shame for what you "allowed," relief at finally naming it—it all makes sense.

Naming is the first step. From here, you can begin to rebuild.

---

## Anchor Phrases

- *"Control disguised as care is still control."*
- *"I was not 'bad with money.' I was controlled."*
- *"Financial abuse is abuse, even without physical violence."*
- *"I am allowed to have my own money, my own information, my own choices."*
- *"What was done to me has a name. That matters."*

---

*"I didn't know the word for what happened to me. Now I do. That's where freedom begins."*
