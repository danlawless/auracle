## Finding Professional Help

### Types of Professionals Who Can Help

**Therapists/Counselors:**
- Look for those specializing in trauma, PTSD, narcissistic abuse, or complex trauma
- Modalities that may help: EMDR, somatic therapy, IFS (Internal Family Systems), DBT, trauma-focused CBT

**Psychiatrists:**
- Can evaluate for conditions that may co-occur (depression, anxiety, PTSD)
- Can prescribe medication if appropriate

**Coaches:**
- Narcissistic abuse recovery coaches (not a replacement for therapy, but can supplement)
- Life coaches specializing in relationship recovery

### Questions to Ask Potential Therapists

1. "What is your experience working with survivors of narcissistic abuse or emotional abuse?"
2. "Are you familiar with concepts like gaslighting, trauma bonding, and coercive control?"
3. "What therapeutic approaches do you use for trauma?"
4. "How do you feel about clients who need to set firm boundaries with family members?"
5. "What is your approach if a client is considering going no-contact with a family member?"

**Red flags in therapists:**
- Pushing for reconciliation without understanding the dynamics
- Minimizing your experience
- Suggesting you need to "forgive and forget"
- Lack of familiarity with narcissistic abuse patterns
- Making you feel judged for your choices

## Safety Planning

### A Personal Note

Before I share this checklist, I want you to know: I did this too.

For months before I left, I quietly sent things I wanted to keep to my parents' home. I had a plan with my therapist—we talked through exactly when and how I would leave. My mom had told me: *when you try to leave, they could try to kill you.*

That didn't happen. But I was cautious anyway.

If you are secretly preparing—sending things to safe places, making quiet plans, having conversations no one knows about—you are not being paranoid. You are being wise. The fact that leaving might go smoothly doesn't mean your preparation was unnecessary. You are honoring what *could* happen, and that is self-protection.

Your caution is not overreaction. It's intelligence.

### Creating a Safety Plan

If you are still in contact with an abusive person, create a safety plan:

1. **Identify safe people** — Who can you call in crisis? Give them context in advance.

2. **Prepare an emergency bag** — Include:
   - Important documents (ID, passport, birth certificates)
   - Medications
   - Cash
   - Phone charger
   - Change of clothes
   - Keys

3. **Know your exits** — At home, at work, in common locations

4. **Document everything** — Save evidence in a place they can't access

5. **Code words** — Establish with trusted people for when you need help

6. **Financial preparation** — Open a separate bank account if possible, know your financial situation

7. **Technology safety:**
   - Check for tracking apps on your phone
   - Use private/incognito browsing
   - Create new email accounts they don't know about
   - Be aware of location sharing settings

## Your First 90 Days: Post-Exit Protocols

### The 90-Day Forward Protocol

A practical roadmap for the first three months post-recognition/exit:

**Days 1-30: Stabilize**
- Establish no contact or minimal contact protocols
- Identify and connect with your safe person
- Begin documentation practice
- One grounding technique daily
- Don't make major life decisions

**Days 31-60: Understand**
- Work through this book systematically
- Identify which tactics were used on you
- Understand your specific vulnerabilities
- Begin therapy if you haven't already
- Start identifying triggers

**Days 61-90: Rebuild**
- Reconnect with abandoned interests/relationships
- Establish daily wellness practices
- Create your support architecture
- Begin setting boundaries in other areas of life
- Start thinking about what you want next

**After 90 Days:**
- Review progress
- Adjust protocols as needed
- Consider longer-term changes (career, location, relationships)
- Continue healing work at your pace

### The Red-Yellow-Green System

For daily check-ins:

**Green:** I feel stable. Practicing my protocols. Not activated.
- Keep doing what you're doing

**Yellow:** I feel triggered or tempted. Old patterns surfacing. Considering contact.
- Deploy emergency protocols
- Contact safe person
- Extra grounding today
- Don't act on impulses

**Red:** Crisis. Overwhelming activation. Relapse or near-relapse.
- Reach out immediately (safe person, therapist, hotline)
- Remove means of contact if possible
- Intense self-care
- No shame—reset and begin again

Check in with yourself daily. Know your color.

*Every time you name the pattern instead of reliving it, your nervous system learns a new route home.*
