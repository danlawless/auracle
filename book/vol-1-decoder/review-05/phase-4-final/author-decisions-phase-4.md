## Section C: Structural Accuracy (Q9-Q12)

### Q9: Lesson Numbering Accuracy

**Options:**
- [ ] A) All lesson numbers accurate and consistent
- [ ] B) Numbering updated but cross-references need verification
- [x] C) Numbering not yet updated
- [ ] D) Conflicts in numbering approach

**Author Decision:** C

**Reasoning:** Confirmed. Numbering conventions are clearly decided (Clara Q12, Q13), but implementation has not begun. This is expected for decision phase.

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. Insert bridge lesson 1.5
2. Rename 3.1 → 3.1a/3.1b
3. Rename 5.4 → 5.4/5.5
4. Create Module 6 lessons (6.1, 6.2, 6.3...)
5. Verify all cross-references

---

### Q10: Count Standardization

**Options:**
- [ ] A) All counts updated throughout
- [ ] B) Most counts updated, some instances remain
- [ ] C) Counts not yet updated
- [x] D) Count breakdown not yet determined

**Author Decision:** D

**Reasoning:** Petra is correct. While we know the total is 52 cards, the Core vs Advanced breakdown has not been determined. Clara Q1 notes "Card Breakdown: To be determined based on final card audit."

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. FIRST: Conduct card audit to determine X Core + Y Advanced = 52
2. THEN: Systematic search-replace for all count references
3. Update: 52 cards, 6 modules, 4-step protocol throughout

---

### Q11: Cross-Reference Accuracy

**Options:**
- [ ] A) All cross-references accurate
- [ ] B) Most accurate, some need updating
- [x] C) Not yet updated
- [ ] D) Curriculum rewrite pending

**Author Decision:** C

**Reasoning:** Confirmed. Cross-references cannot be accurate yet because structural changes (Q9) have not been implemented. This is blocked by Q9.

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. First: Implement structural changes (Q9)
2. Then: Systematic cross-reference update
3. Finally: Verify curriculum/TOC alignment (Clara Q15)

---

### Q12: Duration Recalculation

**Options:**
- [ ] A) All durations recalculated and updated
- [ ] B) Durations estimated but not finalized
- [ ] C) Durations not yet recalculated
- [x] D) Wait until content is finalized

**Author Decision:** D

**Reasoning:** Duration recalculation should wait until content is finalized. Both Felix Q14 and Clara Q11 called for recalculation, but accurate durations require completed content.

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. First: Create all new content (Q4-Q8)
2. Then: Implement structural changes (Q9)
3. Finally: Recalculate all lesson and module durations
4. Expected total: 11-12 hours (per Clara's estimate)
