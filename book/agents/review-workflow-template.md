# Editorial Review Workflow Template

**Principle:** Big-picture changes first, fine details last — structural changes invalidate detailed polish work.

## Phase 1: Strategic Decisions (Do First)

Answer ALL questions in Phase 1 before implementing any changes.

| Order | Status | Agent | Issue | Questions | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | [ ] | **Diana** (Developmental Editor) | #___ | ___ | Structure, themes, narrative arc |
| 2 | [ ] | **Morgan** (Managing Editor) | #___ | ___ | Priorities, conflicts, coordination |

**Why first:** Structural decisions affect everything downstream. If you change chapter order or add/remove content, all detailed polish work becomes invalid.

**Phase 1 Complete:** [ ]
**Structural changes implemented:** [ ]

## Phase 2: Content & Experience

Address after Phase 1 structural decisions are made. These three can be answered in parallel since they address different concerns.

| Order | Status | Agent | Issue | Questions | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| 3 | [ ] | **Bailey** (Beta Reader) | #___ | ___ | Reader engagement, pacing, clarity |
| 4 | [ ] | **Sage** (Sensitivity Reader) | #___ | ___ | Representation, inclusion, trauma-informed |
| 5 | [ ] | **Felix** (Fact-Checker) | #___ | ___ | Sources, accuracy, verification |

**Why this order:** Reader experience and representation concerns may require content changes. Fact-checking verifies claims once content is stable.

**Phase 2 Complete:** [ ]
**Content changes implemented:** [ ]

## Phase 3: Polish

Only begin after content is stable. Do Lydia's line edit first, then Clara's copy edit.

| Order | Status | Agent | Issue | Questions | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| 6 | [ ] | **Lydia** (Line Editor) | #___ | ___ | Prose craft, voice, rhythm |
| 7 | [ ] | **Clara** (Copy Editor) | #___ | ___ | Style consistency, terminology |

**Why this order:** Line editing improves prose quality; copy editing standardizes. Copy editing a passage that will be rewritten by line editing wastes effort.

**Phase 3 Complete:** [ ]
**Polish changes implemented:** [ ]

## Phase 4: Final Pass

Absolutely last — any earlier changes could introduce new errors.

| Order | Status | Agent | Issue | Questions | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| 8 | [ ] | **Petra** (Proofreader) | #___ | ___ | Typos, formatting, final errors |

**Why last:** Proofreading catches the small errors that slip through. Any content changes after proofreading require re-proofreading.

**Phase 4 Complete:** [ ]
**Final corrections applied:** [ ]

## Parallel Work Guide

### Can Answer Together
- **Diana + Morgan** — But answer both before implementing structural changes
- **Bailey + Sage + Felix** — Different concerns with no dependencies
- **Lydia + Clara** — But implement Lydia's suggestions first, then Clara's

### Must Be Sequential
```
Phase 1 (Strategic)
    → Phase 2 (Content)
        → Phase 3 (Polish)
            → Phase 4 (Final)
```

### Critical Rule
**Petra (Proofreader) is always last.** No exceptions.
