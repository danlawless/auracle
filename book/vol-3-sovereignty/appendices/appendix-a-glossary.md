## Key Terms for Sovereignty

---

## A

**Absorption**
The unconscious taking on of another person's emotional state, energy, or needs as if they were your own. Distinguished from empathy, which allows you to feel with someone without becoming their state.

**Activation**
A nervous system state triggered by perceived threat, characterized by heightened arousal, vigilance, or fight/flight responses. In sovereignty work, learning to notice activation without being controlled by it.

**Authority Imprinting**
How past experiences with authority figures shape current responses to statements, opinions, and directives. May cause automatic compliance, automatic resistance, or dysregulation when someone speaks with confidence.

**Anchor Phrase**
A pre-chosen statement that helps return you to center during activation. Examples: "I am the authority in my own life." "I can care without carrying."

**Aura Boundary**
The energetic edge where you end and others begin. Healthy aura boundaries allow connection without merger or absorption.

---

## B

**Body Knowing**
Information that arrives through physical sensation rather than thought. Often more reliable than mental analysis, especially when the mind has been trained to override authentic signals.

---

## C

**Center**
The internal home base from which sovereign decisions are made. Not a physical location but an experiential state of groundedness and self-connection.

**Clean Desire**
Wanting that arises from genuine preference rather than anxiety, scarcity, or survival need. Distinguished by a lack of urgency and ability to tolerate not having.

**Co-regulation**
The process by which regulated nervous systems help dysregulated systems return to baseline. Healthy relationships involve mutual co-regulation without one person becoming solely responsible.

**Counterfactual Rumination**
Regret loops—the mind replaying alternate versions of the past. "I should have..." "If only I had..." Often a form of threat monitoring rather than productive reflection.

**Collapse**
A nervous system response characterized by shutdown, freeze, submission, or going along to avoid conflict. Often accompanied by internal disappearance or self-abandonment.

---

## D

**Differentiation**
The capacity to maintain your own identity, values, and emotional experience while remaining connected to others. The opposite of enmeshment.

**Dorsal Vagal**
The branch of the vagus nerve associated with shutdown, freeze, and collapse states. Activates when the nervous system perceives inescapable threat.

---

## E

**Emotional Contract**
An unspoken agreement about how emotions will be handled in a relationship. Often inherited from family of origin without conscious choice.

**Enmeshment**
A relationship pattern where boundaries dissolve, identities blur, and individual sovereignty is sacrificed for connection. Often feels like closeness but functions as imprisonment.

---

## F

**False Urgency**
The felt sense that something must happen immediately when no actual emergency exists. Often a trauma response rather than accurate assessment.

**Field**
The energetic and emotional atmosphere created by a person or group. Sovereign individuals can hold their own field without being dominated by another's.

---

## G

**Grounding**
The practice of returning attention to the present moment and physical body, especially through feet, breath, and sensation. Essential skill for maintaining sovereignty during activation.

**Gift-Giving as Regulation**
Using gifts to stabilize connection rather than express genuine generosity. The gift becomes a way to maintain presence, control closeness, or manage the giver's anxiety about the relationship.

**Guilt (Old)**
Guilt that arises from ending patterns, setting boundaries, or claiming autonomy—not from actual wrongdoing. Distinguished from conscience-based guilt by its timing and function.

---

## H

**Holding the Field**
The capacity to remain present and regulated in your own energetic space while others are dysregulated, without either absorbing their state or disconnecting from relationship.

---

## I

**Internal Authority**
The capacity to trust your own perception, make decisions from your own values, and act without requiring external validation. The core skill of sovereignty.

**Interoception**
The ability to sense internal body states—hunger, fatigue, emotion, safety. Often impaired in those who learned to track external cues for safety.

**Joy Tolerance (Optimizer Pattern)**
Difficulty allowing pleasure without seeking improvement. The moment you feel pleasure, a protective voice suggests how it could be better. Not ingratitude—the nervous system learned that joy was followed by disappointment.

---

## L

**Landed**
A body-based state of presence and stability. The sensation of being in your body, connected to the ground, and occupying your own space.

---

## N

**Neutral Presence**
The capacity to witness without reacting, absorbing, or fixing. Not coldness, but spacious attention that doesn't require action.

**Neuroception**
The nervous system's unconscious assessment of safety or danger. Happens faster than conscious thought and drives many automatic reactions.

---

## O

**Over-functioning**
Taking responsibility for tasks, emotions, or outcomes that belong to someone else. Often a survival strategy that becomes an identity trap.

---

## P

**Parasympathetic**
The branch of the autonomic nervous system associated with rest, digest, and calm states. Activated when the body perceives safety.

**Prefrontal Cortex**
The brain region responsible for executive function, planning, and conscious decision-making. Goes offline during high activation, returns when regulated.

---

## R

**Reflexive Counterbalancing (Protective Contrarianism)**
Automatically adding counterpoints, diffusing ideas, or avoiding clear stances. Not intellectual honesty—regulatory strategy. The nervous system learned that imbalance or certainty led to danger.

**Regulation**
The capacity to return your nervous system to a calm, present state after activation. Not the absence of emotion but the ability to move through it.

**Return to Sender**
A sovereignty practice of mentally returning energy, emotion, or responsibility that belongs to someone else rather than continuing to carry it.

---

## S

**Self-Abandonment**
The pattern of betraying your own needs, perceptions, or values to maintain connection or avoid conflict. The opposite of sovereignty.

**Self-Contained Return**
The recognition that discomfort can arise internally without requiring external repair. System stabilizes without seeking relational resolution. Clarity functions as containment.

**Soothing**
Any behavior that provides temporary relief from discomfort. Distinguished from regulation, which addresses the underlying nervous system state.

**Sovereignty**
Living from internal authority—making decisions from your own center, trusting your perception, and maintaining your boundaries without requiring external validation.

**Sympathetic**
The branch of the autonomic nervous system associated with activation, mobilization, and stress responses.

---

## V

**Vagus Nerve**
The longest cranial nerve, connecting brain to body. Central to the polyvagal system that governs states of safety, mobilization, and shutdown.

**Ventral Vagal**
The branch of the vagus nerve associated with social engagement, safety, and connection. The target state for regulated sovereignty.

---

## W

**Window of Tolerance**
The range of arousal within which a person can function effectively. Outside this window, one moves into hyperarousal (fight/flight) or hypoarousal (freeze/collapse).
