## The Only Resource

You have completed the series.

The resource is now you.

## Practice Reminders

### Daily

- Presence over performance
- Allowing over forcing
- Trust over control

### Weekly

- Notice what's emerging
- Track synchronicities
- Celebrate ordinary magic

### Ongoing

- Return to earlier volumes as needed
- Trust your own authority
- Live the teaching

## Community

If community calls:
- Find others doing this work
- Share from sovereignty, not need
- Build from presence, not performance

---

## Final Words

You don't need more resources.

You need to live what you've learned.

The rest will emerge.

*"You are the resource you were seeking."*
