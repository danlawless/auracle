## Daily Practices (1-5 Minutes Each)

### 60-Second Field Scan

**When:** Start of day, before entering charged spaces

**How:**
1. Stand or sit. Close eyes.
2. Imagine your field as a bubble around you.
3. Scan: Front, back, left, right, above, below.
4. Notice without changing: Where is it clear? Cluttered? Defended?
5. Three breaths. Return to room.

---

### Pre-Day Seal

**When:** Each morning before engaging with the world

**How:**
1. Stand or sit. Three deep breaths.
2. Feel your field—the space around your body.
3. Say internally: *"Today I move through the world in my own field. I can perceive without absorbing. What I encounter stays with me only by my choice."*
4. Visualize your field becoming clear, coherent.
5. Begin your day.

---

### Return to Sender

**When:** After absorbing energy that isn't yours

**How:**
1. Notice you're carrying something foreign.
2. Hand on chest. Say internally: *"This is not mine. I release it with compassion. Return to sender."*
3. Imagine the energy lifting from your field—without hostility.
4. Fill the space with your own breath.

---

### 90-Second Vagal Reset

**When:** Activated and need to regulate quickly

**How:**
1. Stop whatever you're doing.
2. Orient: Slowly look around the room without urgency.
3. Breathe: Inhale 4 counts, exhale 6-8 counts. Repeat 4-5 times.
4. Ground: Feel feet on floor, weight of body.
5. Check: Has your state shifted?

---

### Post-Day Clearing

**When:** Each evening before rest

**How:**
1. Sit or lie down. Close eyes.
2. Scan body and field for heaviness or unfamiliarity.
3. Ask: "What am I carrying that isn't mine?"
4. With each exhale, release what isn't yours.
5. When clearer, hand on chest: *"What remains is mine. I rest in myself."*
6. Sleep.

## Weekly Practices (20-60 Minutes)

### Cord Check Protocol

**When:** Weekly, or when feeling energetically drained

**How:**
1. Sit quietly. Close eyes.
2. Scan for where attention is going:
   - Who are you thinking about without choosing to?
   - Who pulls at your energy when they're not present?
3. For each cord, ask:
   - Is this nourishing or draining?
   - Is this appropriate to the relationship?
4. For draining cords, use release practice:
   - *"I release this attachment to its right size. I am connected but not entangled."*
5. Breathe. Feel the space.

---

### Digital Audit

**When:** Weekly

**How:**
1. Review: What did I consume digitally this week?
2. Notice: What groups/accounts consistently leave me feeling worse?
3. Clean: Mute, unfollow, or leave as needed.
4. Boundary: Set one digital boundary for next week.

---

3. **Cord inventory:** Full review of all significant relationships
4. **Longer practice:** Extended meditation, retreat, or nature time

---

### Monthly Relationship Audit

For each significant relationship:
1. Do I feel more me around this person, or less?
2. Is the energy mutual, or draining?
3. Are my boundaries respected?
4. Can we hold difference?
5. Decision: Continue, adjust, reduce, or end?
