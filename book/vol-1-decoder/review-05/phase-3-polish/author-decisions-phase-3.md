# LYDIA (Line Editor) - 18 Questions

## VOICE CONSISTENCY (Q1-Q6)

### Q1: Author's Personal Story Voice

**Context:** Phase 2 adds author's personal story to Lesson 1.1 - raised in household leading to choosing narcissist/dysregulated husband, breaking pattern through awareness.

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Brief, impactful first person: "I know this path. I walked it for decades before I could see it clearly."
- [ ] B) Extended narrative with emotional detail: "The first time I realized what was happening..."
- [ ] C) Interwoven reflection: First person story woven through second person teaching
- [ ] D) Separate clearly marked section: "Author's Note:" or similar framing

**Lydia's Preference:** A or C
**Lydia's Reasoning:** The existing voice is direct, validating, and authoritative. Personal story needs to enhance this rather than undercut it. Too much vulnerability could shift the power dynamic.

**Author Decision:** _____________
**Reasoning:**

---

### Q2: Male Example Voice Calibration

**Context:** Phase 2 adds male-specific examples including "baby trap" scenario.

**Options:**

- [ ] C) Alternating pronoun use in new examples without calling attention to it
- [ ] D) Dedicated male perspective sidebars with distinct but consistent voice

**Lydia's Preference:** A with elements of D
**Lydia's Reasoning:** The best representation feels invisible—readers see themselves without needing to be told they're being included. Heavy-handed framing can feel patronizing.

**Author Decision:** _____________
**Reasoning:**

---

### Q3: Module 6 Voice Establishment

- [ ] C) Celebratory shift: "You've come so far. Now let's go deeper."
- [ ] D) Technical shift: Slightly more clinical/precise language for advanced patterns

**Lydia's Preference:** C
**Lydia's Reasoning:** By Module 6, readers have absorbed significant content. Treating them exactly the same as Module 1 readers could feel condescending. But trauma doesn't heal linearly—acknowledge growth without assuming safety.

**Author Decision:** _____________
**Reasoning:**

---

### Q4: "Three Things You Need to Hear" Section Voice

**Context:** Phase 2 creates dedicated validation section with "You are not crazy / not weak / not alone" with breathing space between.

- [ ] B) Brief expansion: Each statement followed by one sentence of context
- [ ] C) Guided meditation style: Slower, more spacious, with breath cues
- [ ] D) Repeating pattern: Each statement followed by "Let that land."

**Lydia's Preference:** A or D
**Lydia's Reasoning:** These are the most emotionally vulnerable moments. Overwriting kills them. The space around the words matters more than the words themselves.

**Author Decision:** _____________
**Reasoning:**

---

### Q5: Quick Read Summaries Voice

**Context:** Phase 2 adds "Quick Read" summary boxes at the start of each lesson.

**Options:**

**Author Decision:** _____________
**Reasoning:**

---

- [ ] C) Named archetypes: "Sarah, 34, recognized this pattern in her workplace..."
- [ ] D) Minimal attribution: Brief quotes without extensive framing

**Reasoning:**

---

## RHYTHM AND PACING (Q7-Q12)

### Q7: Module 2 Scenario Breaks - Rhythm

- [ ] D) Integrated summary: 3.1b opens with brief recap connecting to 3.1a

**Lydia's Preference:** B with elements of D

**Lydia's Preference:** C or D

**Author Decision:** _____________
**Reasoning:**

---

**Lydia's Reasoning:** The 4-step version is cleaner. Drawing attention to the change creates cognitive load.

**Author Decision:** _____________
**Reasoning:**

---

**Author Decision:** _____________
**Reasoning:**

---

## EMOTIONAL CALIBRATION (Q13-Q18)

- [ ] C) Context-specific: Tie each instance to the specific content of that lesson
- [ ] D) Progressive depth: Each repetition adds a layer of meaning

**Lydia's Preference:** C or D
