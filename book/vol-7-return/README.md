## 📖 How to Read This Book

This book is not about getting rich.

It is about building a life that matches the healing you've done.

If you have completed the earlier volumes, you've done the inner work. Now it's time for the outer work—the career, the finances, the material foundations that support a sovereign life.

---

## 🌟 The Promise

By the end of this book, you will:

1. **Understand** how financial abuse and control affected you
2. **Recognize** scarcity patterns in your relationship with money
3. **Rebuild** practical financial foundations
4. **Reclaim** professional identity after trauma
5. **Navigate** workplace dynamics with sovereignty
6. **Build** businesses or careers aligned with your values
7. **Receive** money and success without guilt
8. **Create** a life of sustainable prosperity

## 💬 A Note Before You Begin

> *You've done the inner work.*
>
> *You can name the patterns. You've healed the nervous system. You've installed sovereignty. You've begun to inhabit your presence.*
>
> *But something is still missing.*
>
> *Maybe it's the career you lost to the relationship. Maybe it's the savings that were drained. Maybe it's the scarcity that still lives in your body, even when the bank account says otherwise.*
>
> *This book is about the return.*
>
> *Not returning to who you were before—that person is gone. But returning to the world with your whole self. Building a life that matches the healing you've done. Letting your outer world catch up to your inner one.*
>
> *You are allowed to thrive. Not just survive.*

## 🌉 The Core Principle

**You are allowed to thrive, not just survive.**

Financial abuse, career derailment, and scarcity mindset are embedded in most narcissistic dynamics. Healing isn't complete until your material life reflects your inner work.

Prosperity is not betrayal. It is a fruit of healing.

---

## 📘 Before This Book

This book assumes you have:
- Named your patterns → **[Volume 1: The Narcissism Decoder](../vol-1-decoder/README.md)**
- Begun healing → **[Volume 2: The Bridge](../vol-2-bridge/README.md)**
- Installed sovereignty → **[Volume 3: Sovereignty](../vol-3-sovereignty/README.md)**

This volume can be read alongside or after Volumes 4-6. It addresses a parallel track: while those volumes cover presence, parenting, and purpose, this covers prosperity.
