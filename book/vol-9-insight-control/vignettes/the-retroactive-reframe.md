# The Retroactive Reframe

**Volume 9 Case Vignette — Appendix C**

---

## Context

Maya had agreed to a mutual in-trade collaboration with Sage, a practitioner she'd met in a spiritual community. During their exchange, what was framed as an exploratory conversation became a sales pitch for Sage's paid services.

## The Exchange

**June 24**

**Sage:** thanks so much for being open to go in the crunchy spaces I was feeling so much of my own resistance too but it feels transformative and practicing is great!

**June 25**

**Sage:** Hey Maya! I'm sorry if yesterday felt crunchy / uncomfortable. I hope you can see the benefit in all the questions we looked at (please correct me if I am wrong) You are a great sales person too. And I would love to be on the same team as you one day. I'm sure I can learn a lot from the sales process you learned too.

**Maya:** Hey Sage, No apologies needed at all. Just feels like we're looking for different kinds of exchanges right now.

I hold deep respect for your time, your path, and your unique gifts, and I fully understand your desire to be compensated for what you offer.

From the beginning, I felt aligned with a mutual in-trade collaboration, which for me represented a balanced and heartfelt exchange. So, when the structure shifted yesterday, I recognized and felt as though the original intention no longer resonated for you.

**July 5**

**Sage:** You are incredible!! I hold deep respect for your gifts too. It felt super heartfelt to me too. I hope we can move forward and find deeper alignment. I was just practicing pitching and of course I can learn lots from the different styles of pitching. I've been drained from my adrenals & wanting to reply sooner. I look forward to reconnecting soon!

**July 14**

**Maya:** Hey sweetheart, I say this with love - what you're saying feels like an excuse to me and a way to avoid accountability.

**Sage:** Could you clarify what you mean by accountability?

**Sage:** It hurts my heart to have this misunderstanding/disconnection with you & would love to clear & find resonance

**Maya:** Listen, when you say you were "just practicing," it dismisses the reality of what happened. You didn't come with transparency. The structure you used was clearly a marketing pitch, not a practice run, and my time and aura were engaged under a different understanding. You turned that time into an opportunity to pitch for money, and now you're reframing it as practice after the fact. That's not honest.

Let's be clear: if I had said yes, you would have accepted the payment. So saying you "didn't really mean it" doesn't align with the energy of the exchange. You were pitching and practicing sales without informing me that's what I was participating in.

I didn't agree to be part of a sales rehearsal. I offered my expertise and energy in good faith, not to be a silent participant in an unspoken strategy. So when you say it was just practice, it feels like you're trying to retroactively excuse what was actually a real pitch disguised as something else.

Hope that makes sense to you as to why "I was just practicing" doesn't resonate.

**Sage:** Listen, we're all going through massive transformation right now. That process was transformative even if it was uncomfortable. I don't see anything wrong with pitching. I have friends that pitch me and if I don't want what they sell then I say no. And I say to not pitch again. As simple as that. No fuss.

I am in a process of learning and testing out what is right for me. And it would be nice for you to see that and observe the transformation vs feels like judging the process.

I asked you if it was okay to push and to see explore what it would be like to work together. I wasn't planning on pitching you that day but it probably came through because of a business accelerator program I was in this year, which I do not resonate with all of their sales processes. I would rather be on qualified sales calls of course when it's already framed. And I would rather just be selling software that supports our soul growth to build our content and our funnels online.

I am in a very painful place in my life. My gut isn't healing. And I have to really let go of any negative ideas about this so I can heal.

In the beginning I shared it would be cool to do a simple trade, one for one. So that's why I wanted to get clear after on how we could work together. Also that content I gave you is super good of you and would be valuable content for you to post so people can feel what you do. You are incredibly talented!

**Maya:** Wishing you good healing!

**July 16**

**Maya:** And also, Sage, please know I'm not holding any negativity. I absolutely don't hold anything in my heart other than love, truth and light towards you and all my sisters. Truly sending you good thoughts for healing.

**Sage:** Thank you. I appreciate that a lot. Setting the intention to find more synergy and learn from it all. Would love to tune in sometime soon.

## Teaching Points

This exchange illustrates several patterns common in conscious community dynamics:

### The Retroactive Reframe
"I was just practicing" only emerged after the pitch was declined. The test: *If she had said yes, would payment have been accepted?* Yes. Therefore it wasn't practice.

### Transformation as Shield
"We're all going through massive transformation" redirects accountability into a shared spiritual experience where boundaries become "judgment."

### Health Crisis as Leverage
"My gut isn't healing. And I have to really let go of any negative ideas about this so I can heal" implies that Maya's boundary is causing physical harm.

### Program Blame
Attributing the behavior to an external program ("a business accelerator I was in") distances the person from their own choices.

### Flattery During Confrontation
"You are incredibly talented!" arrives at the moment of highest accountability pressure.

### The Judgment Flip
"It would be nice for you to see that and observe the transformation vs feels like judging the process" reframes a valid boundary as a character flaw.

## Pattern Cross-References

This vignette demonstrates patterns from:
- **Chapter 4:** Pattern 3 (Misrepresentation as Recruitment)
- **Chapter 6:** Financial Ambiguity as Leverage
- **Chapter 7:** Mentorship dynamics and "transformation" language as control

## What Sovereignty Looks Like

Maya's response models clarity without cruelty:
- Names the specific behavior without character assassination
- Applies the logic test ("if I had said yes...")
- Maintains warmth while holding the boundary
- Doesn't abandon herself to preserve the connection
- Returns with genuine care after the confrontation lands

*"I absolutely don't hold anything in my heart other than love, truth and light towards you and all my sisters."*

Sovereignty isn't hardness. It's the capacity to hold truth and love simultaneously.
