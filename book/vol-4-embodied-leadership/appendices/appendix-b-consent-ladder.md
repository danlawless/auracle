# Appendix B: The Consent Ladder

## Yes / Maybe / No / Later

A tool for tracking your internal signal moment to moment.

---

## The Four States

### YES

**Body signals:**
- Chest open
- Breath full and deepening
- Energy rising
- Body moving toward
- Warmth spreading
- Presence increasing

**Internal experience:**
- Clear desire
- Openness
- Curiosity
- Wanting to move forward

**What it sounds like:**
- "Yes"
- "I want this"
- "I'm in"

---

### MAYBE

**Body signals:**
- Mixed signals
- Breath uncertain
- Some openness, some holding back
- Body ambivalent
- Neither moving toward nor pulling away

**Internal experience:**
- Curiosity with hesitation
- Need more information
- Not sure yet
- Part yes, part unsure

**What it sounds like:**
- "I need to think about it"
- "Can you tell me more?"
- "I'm not sure yet"
- "Part of me wants to, part of me isn't sure"

**What to do:**
- Slow down
- Ask for what you need (more information, time, space)
- Don't override the ambivalence
- Check back in with your body

---

### NO

**Body signals:**
- Chest closing or tightening
- Breath shallow or held
- Body pulling away
- Tension increasing
- Energy dropping or bracing
- Urge to leave

**Internal experience:**
- Don't want this
- Resistance
- Discomfort
- Wanting to stop

**What it sounds like:**
- "No"
- "I don't want to"
- "I'm not available for that"
- "Stop"

**What to do:**
- Honor the signal
- Speak the no (if safe)
- Remove yourself if needed
- Don't override

---

### LATER

**Body signals:**
- Desire present but timing off
- Body wants to wait
- Interest without urgency
- Preference for future, not now

**Internal experience:**
- "Yes, but not now"
- "I want this eventually"
- "The timing isn't right"
- "Not ready yet"

**What it sounds like:**
- "Can we wait?"
- "I'm not ready for that yet"
- "Maybe later"
- "Not tonight"

**What to do:**
- Name the timing without dismissing the desire
- Set a future time if appropriate
- Trust the timing signal

## Using the Ladder in Real Time

### During Intimacy

At any moment, check: **Where am I on this ladder right now?**

Your position can change. That's allowed.

**If you shift from Yes to Maybe:** Slow down. Check in.

**If you shift from Yes to No:** Stop. Name it.

**If you shift from Maybe to Yes:** Proceed consciously.

**If you shift from Maybe to No:** Honor it without guilt.

---

### In Relationships

Use the ladder for any decision or request:

- Plans
- Commitments
- Conversations
- Topics
- Depth of sharing

Always track: **Is this a yes, a maybe, a no, or a later?**

---

### At Work

Apply the same framework:

- Projects
- Meetings
- Collaborations
- Requests for your time

Your internal signal applies everywhere.

---

## The Color System

A complementary tool for quick reference:

### 🟢 GREEN (Go)

- Clear yes
- Body open
- Desire present
- Proceed

### 🟡 YELLOW (Pause)

- Mixed signals
- Slow down
- Check in
- Get more information

### 🔴 RED (Stop)

- Clear no
- Body closing
- Stop immediately
- No explanation needed

---

## Teaching the Ladder to Partners

You can share this framework:

**Script:**
"I use this internal check-in where I track whether something is a yes, maybe, no, or later. It helps me stay present. Can I share with you where I am?"

**During intimacy:**
"I'm at a maybe right now. Let me check in."

"That moved me from yes to later."

"Green light. Keep going."

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't feel my signals"

This is common, especially after trauma. Start by:
- Noticing after the fact ("That was a no and I didn't feel it")
- Practicing in low-stakes situations
- Slowing everything down

The signals strengthen with practice.

### "My signals change too fast"

That's okay. They're allowed to change. The practice is noticing the changes, not having stable signals.

### "My signals conflict with my thoughts"

Trust the body. The body often knows before the mind does. Let the body lead.

### "I don't want to disappoint them"

Your signal matters more than their expectation. A clear no is kinder than a resentful yes.
