# Appendix B: The Consent Ladder

## Yes / Maybe / No / Later

A tool for tracking your internal signal moment to moment.

---

## Why This Tool Exists

For many of us, consent wasn't something we learned.

We learned to override our signals. To say yes when we meant no. To go along. To accommodate. To freeze and call it agreement.

This tool helps you reconnect to what your body is actually saying—not what you think you should feel, not what makes others comfortable, but what is actually true for you in this moment.

**The consent ladder is not about permission.** It's about awareness. It's learning to read your own signals clearly, so you can make choices that honor what's true.

## The Four States

### YES

**Body signals:**
- Chest open and expansive
- Breath full and deepening naturally
- Energy rising, leaning forward
- Body moving toward the person or experience
- Warmth spreading through body
- Presence increasing—you feel more here, not less
- Softening in jaw, shoulders, belly
- Ease in the body, not tension disguised as excitement

**Internal experience:**
- Clear desire without pressure
- Openness and curiosity
- Wanting to move forward
- Feeling of rightness
- Presence, not escape
- This feels like choice, not obligation

**What it sounds like:**
- "Yes"
- "I want this"
- "I'm in"
- "This feels good"
- "Keep going"

**The quality of yes:**
A real yes has spaciousness. It doesn't feel frantic, obligated, or pressured. It feels like opening, not bracing.

If your "yes" feels tight, urgent, or like you're convincing yourself—check again. That might be something else.

---

### MAYBE

**Body signals:**
- Mixed signals in the body
- Breath uncertain or variable
- Some openness, some holding back
- Body ambivalent—neither toward nor away
- Part of you interested, part hesitant
- Tension and openness coexisting
- A sense of "something's not quite landing"

**Internal experience:**
- Curiosity mixed with hesitation
- Need for more information
- Not sure yet
- Part yes, part unsure
- Wanting to slow down
- Waiting for something to become clear

**What it sounds like:**
- "I need to think about it"
- "Can you tell me more?"
- "I'm not sure yet"
- "Part of me wants to, part of me isn't sure"
- "Give me a minute"
- "I need to check in with myself"
- "Let me sit with that"

**What to do with maybe:**

**Slow down.** Maybe is not a problem to solve—it's information to honor.

**Ask for what you need:**
- More information
- More time
- More space
- Something to change

**Don't override the ambivalence.** The body knows something. Give it time to speak.

**Check back in with your body.** Put your hand on your chest or belly. Ask: "What is actually true right now?" Wait for the answer—don't manufacture one.

**Important:** Maybe is not a soft no you're too scared to say. Maybe is genuinely uncertain. If it's actually a no, name it as a no.

---

### NO

**Body signals:**
- Chest closing or tightening
- Breath shallow, held, or constricted
- Body pulling away, leaning back
- Tension increasing, particularly in shoulders, jaw, belly
- Energy dropping or bracing for impact
- Urge to leave, escape, or withdraw
- Contraction rather than expansion
- A sense of wrongness, even if you can't articulate why

**Internal experience:**
- Don't want this
- Resistance
- Discomfort
- Wanting to stop
- A sense of wrongness
- Feeling pressured
- Relief at the thought of ending this

**What it sounds like:**
- "No"
- "I don't want to"
- "I'm not available for that"
- "Stop"
- "That's not going to work for me"
- "I need to end this"

**What to do with no:**

**Honor the signal.** This is the practice. Your body said no. The work is trusting that.

**Speak the no (if safe).** A no doesn't need explanation or justification. "No" is a complete sentence.

**Remove yourself if needed.** You can leave. You can stop. You can end the conversation, the encounter, the situation.

**Don't override.** The pattern of overriding no is what got you here. Break the pattern.

**No explanation required.** You don't owe anyone an explanation for your no. "I don't want to" is enough.

---

### LATER

**Body signals:**
- Desire present but timing off
- Body wants to wait, not to refuse
- Interest without urgency
- Preference for future, not now
- Openness that hasn't fully arrived yet
- A sense of "not yet" rather than "not ever"

**Internal experience:**
- "Yes, but not now"
- "I want this eventually"
- "The timing isn't right"
- "Not ready yet"
- "This would be good, but not today"
- "I need something else first"

**What it sounds like:**
- "Can we wait?"
- "I'm not ready for that yet"
- "Maybe later"
- "Not tonight"
- "I'd like to, but not right now"
- "Ask me again another time"
- "I want to, just not yet"

**What to do with later:**

**Name the timing without dismissing the desire.** "I want this—and not right now" honors both truths.

**Set a future time if appropriate.** If you can, specify when later might be.

**Trust the timing signal.** Your body knows something about pacing that your mind might not.

**Don't let later become avoidance.** Check: Is this genuinely "later," or am I afraid to say no?

## Using the Ladder in Real Time

### During Intimacy

At any moment, check: **Where am I on this ladder right now?**

Your position can change. That's allowed. That's expected. That's healthy.

**If you shift from Yes to Maybe:** Slow down. Check in. Say: "I want to pause for a moment."

**If you shift from Yes to No:** Stop. Name it. "I need to stop." You don't need to explain.

**If you shift from Maybe to Yes:** Proceed consciously. Make sure it's a real yes, not relief at making a decision.

**If you shift from Maybe to No:** Honor it without guilt. "I've checked in, and it's a no."

**If you shift from Later to Yes:** Great. Make sure nothing else changed to make you override yourself.

**If you shift from Later to No:** Also valid. Later doesn't mean eventually. It means not now—and sometimes not now becomes never.

**Checking in with yourself:**
- Hand on belly: "What does my body say?"
- One breath: Let the answer emerge
- Trust what comes, even if it's inconvenient

---

### In Relationships

Use the ladder for any decision or request:

- Plans: "Do I want to go to this event?"
- Commitments: "Do I want to agree to this obligation?"
- Conversations: "Do I want to have this conversation right now?"
- Topics: "Do I want to discuss this subject?"
- Depth of sharing: "Do I want to share this much?"
- Requests: "Do I want to do what they're asking?"

**Always track: Is this a yes, a maybe, a no, or a later?**

The ladder isn't just for sexuality. It's for every choice where your body has information.

---

### At Work

Apply the same framework:

- Projects: "Do I want to take this on?"
- Meetings: "Do I need to be at this meeting?"
- Collaborations: "Do I want to work with this person?"
- Requests for your time: "Do I want to give this time?"
- Deadlines: "Is this timeline realistic for me?"
- Promotions: "Do I actually want this role?"

**Your internal signal applies everywhere.** The body doesn't distinguish between contexts. It just knows what it knows.

---

### In Friendship

- Invitations: "Do I actually want to attend?"
- Requests for support: "Do I have capacity for this?"
- Depth of sharing: "Is this the person I want to share this with?"
- Time together: "Do I want to spend time with this person right now?"
- Emotional labor: "Do I want to hold space for their processing?"

---

## The Color System

A complementary tool for quick reference:

### 🟢 GREEN (Go)

- Clear yes
- Body open and moving toward
- Desire present
- **Action:** Proceed

### 🟡 YELLOW (Pause)

- Mixed signals
- Uncertainty or ambivalence
- Something needs clarification
- **Action:** Slow down. Check in. Get more information.

### 🔴 RED (Stop)

- Clear no
- Body closing or pulling away
- Discomfort, resistance, wrongness
- **Action:** Stop immediately. No explanation needed.

---

## Communicating With the Ladder

### Teaching the Ladder to Partners

You can share this framework:

**Introduction script:**
"I use this internal check-in where I track whether something is a yes, maybe, no, or later. It helps me stay present and honest. Can I share with you where I am when we're together?"

**During intimacy:**
- "I'm at a maybe right now. Let me check in."
- "That moved me from yes to later."
- "Green light. Keep going."
- "I'm noticing some yellow. Can we slow down?"
- "That's a no for me right now."
- "I'm back to yes."

**Why this helps:**
- Creates shared language
- Removes pressure to guess what the other person wants
- Makes consent a conversation, not a one-time question
- Normalizes checking in and changing

---

### Asking a Partner

You can also use the ladder to check in with others:

- "Where are you on the ladder right now?"
- "Is this still a green light for you?"
- "I noticed you got quiet—are you at a maybe?"
- "Would you check in with yourself and tell me where you are?"

**Important:** Their answer is information, not an invitation to convince them otherwise. If they're at a maybe, slow down. If they're at a no, stop. If they're at a later, respect the timing.

## Reclaiming Your Signals

For many readers of this book, the signals are muted, confused, or distorted.

### "I can't feel my signals"

This is common, especially after trauma or years of overriding.

**Start by:**
- Noticing after the fact: "That was a no and I didn't feel it until later"
- Practicing in low-stakes situations: Start with food, clothes, social invitations—not high-stakes intimacy
- Slowing everything down: Speed is the enemy of awareness

**What helps:**
- Hand on body when making decisions (belly, chest)
- Taking three breaths before answering any request
- Asking yourself: "What does my body say?" and waiting for an answer
- Practicing saying no in safe contexts to rebuild the neural pathway

**The signals strengthen with practice.** You learned to override them. You can learn to feel them again.

---

### "My signals change too fast"

That's okay. They're allowed to change.

The practice isn't having stable signals—it's noticing the changes.

**What helps:**
- Accepting that signals can shift moment to moment
- Checking in frequently rather than assuming the first signal is the only one
- Communicating changes as they happen: "I shifted. Can we pause?"

---

### "My signals conflict with my thoughts"

**Trust the body.** The body often knows before the mind does.

Your mind might think: "I should want this." "They'll be disappointed." "We've already started."

Your body might say: "No."

**Let the body lead.** The mind can rationalize anything. The body doesn't lie.

---

### "I don't want to disappoint them"

Your signal matters more than their expectation.

**A clear no is kinder than a resentful yes.** A reluctant yes damages connection more than a compassionate no.

You're not responsible for their disappointment. You're responsible for your honesty.

---

### "I've said yes and now I want to say no"

**You can change your mind.** At any point. For any reason.

- "I know I said yes, but I need to change that."
- "I've checked in with myself and I'm at a no now."
- "I want to stop."

**You don't owe continuity.** Consent is ongoing, not a one-time agreement.

---

### "I said no but they're pressuring me"

**Your no is still no.** Pressure doesn't transform no into yes—it transforms consent into coercion.

**Scripts for held boundaries:**
- "I've given you my answer."
- "I'm not going to change my mind on this."
- "Please stop asking."
- "I need you to respect my no."
- "This conversation is over."

**If pressure continues:** Leave if you can. This is not a partner who respects your signals.

---

## The Body's Wisdom

### What the Body Knows

Your body carries millions of years of survival intelligence.

It knows threat before your mind does. It knows safety before your mind does. It knows desire before your mind does.

When the body says no, it's protecting you. When the body says yes, it's opening to life. When the body says maybe, it's asking for more information. When the body says later, it's managing pacing.

**The practice is listening.** Not overriding. Not rationalizing. Listening.

---

### The Speed of Signals

Body signals are fast. Faster than thought.

By the time you're thinking "I should want this," your body has already responded.

**Pay attention to first reactions:**
- The slight recoil
- The micro-expansion
- The held breath
- The softening

These are data. Trust them.

---

### When Signals Were Ignored

If your signals were ignored early in life—by caregivers, partners, or by yourself—they may have quieted.

This doesn't mean they're gone. It means they've been trained into silence.

The work is retraining. Showing your body that its signals matter again. That you'll listen. That it's safe to speak.

**This takes time.** Be patient. The body is learning to trust you again.

---

## Summary Table

| State | Body Signal | Internal Experience | Action |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| YES | Open, toward, expansive | Clear desire, wanting | Proceed |
| MAYBE | Mixed, uncertain | Part yes, part unsure | Slow down, check in |
| NO | Closed, away, contracted | Resistance, don't want | Stop |
| LATER | Interest, wrong timing | Not yet, not now | Wait, revisit |

---

## Daily Practice

Each day, practice using the ladder in low-stakes situations:

**Morning:** What is my body's yes/no about the day ahead?

**Meals:** Do I actually want to eat this? Is it a yes or a should?

**Invitations:** Before responding, check: What does my body say?

**Conversations:** Am I at a yes for this depth of sharing?

**Evening:** Did I honor my signals today? Where did I override?

The more you practice in small moments, the easier it becomes in high-stakes ones.

---

## The Core Truth

**Your body speaks before your mind.** Your job is to listen.

The consent ladder is not about giving permission—it's about receiving information.

Your body knows what you want, what you don't want, what you need to think about, and what needs to wait.

The practice is trusting what it tells you.
