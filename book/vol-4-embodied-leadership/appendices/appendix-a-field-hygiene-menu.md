## Daily Practices (1-5 Minutes Each)

### 60-Second Field Scan

**When:** Start of day, before entering charged spaces, whenever you feel "off"

**Purpose:** To return awareness to yourself, notice what you're carrying, establish baseline

**How:**
1. Stand or sit. Close eyes if possible.
2. Imagine your field as a bubble around you—extending about arm's length in all directions.
3. Scan systematically: Front. Back. Left. Right. Above. Below.
4. Notice without changing: Where is it clear? Cluttered? Defended? Open? Contracted?
5. Three slow breaths. Notice any shifts.
6. Return to the room.

**What you might notice:**
- Heaviness in certain areas (often where you absorb from others)
- Openness in front, defended in back (common pattern)
- Sense of leaking or diffusing outward
- Tight spots that correspond to body tension

**The practice is noticing, not fixing.** Just seeing clearly is already shifting something.

---

### Pre-Day Seal

**When:** Each morning before engaging with the world—before phone, email, or interaction

**Purpose:** To establish your field as yours before you encounter others' energy

**How:**
1. Stand or sit. Three deep breaths—in through nose, out through mouth.
2. Feel your field—the space around your body. It exists whether you sense it or not.
3. Say internally (or aloud if alone): *"Today I move through the world in my own field. I can perceive without absorbing. What I encounter stays with me only by my choice."*
4. Visualize your field becoming clear, coherent, gently bounded—not a wall, but a membrane.
5. Feel the difference between open (permeable) and porous (leaking).
6. Begin your day.

**Variation for challenging days:**
Add: *"Today I may encounter [name person/situation]. I can be present without being absorbed. Their state is theirs. Mine is mine."*

---

### Return to Sender

**When:** After absorbing energy that isn't yours—you feel heavier after contact, carrying someone's mood, drained without reason

**Purpose:** To release what isn't yours without hostility or drama

**How:**
1. Notice you're carrying something foreign. Name it: "I'm carrying something that isn't mine."
2. Hand on chest (or belly, whichever feels more grounding).
3. Say internally: *"This is not mine. I release it with compassion. Return to sender."*
4. Imagine the energy lifting from your field—not with force, but like steam rising. No hostility, no rejection—just release.
5. Fill the space with your own breath. Imagine your own energy returning to the vacated space.
6. Check: Is there more? Repeat if needed.

**Important distinctions:**
- This is not about rejecting the person—just the energy that lodged in you
- Compassion is key. "Return to sender" isn't a curse—it's a release
- Their energy isn't bad—it's just not yours to carry

**For specific situations:**
- After a difficult conversation: "I release what was transferred. What happened stays with them."
- After absorbing a group mood: "I release the collective heaviness. It is not mine."
- After time with a draining person: "I return what was deposited. My field is my own."

---

### 90-Second Vagal Reset

**When:** Activated and need to regulate quickly—before meetings, after conflict, when you notice fight/flight/freeze

**Purpose:** To shift from sympathetic (activated) to ventral vagal (safe/social) state

**How:**
1. Stop whatever you're doing. This takes 90 seconds. You have 90 seconds.
2. **Orient:** Slowly look around the room without urgency. Let your eyes land on objects. No rush. The slow gaze signals safety to the nervous system.
3. **Breathe:** Inhale 4 counts, exhale 6-8 counts. Repeat 4-5 times. Longer exhales activate the parasympathetic nervous system.
4. **Ground:** Feel feet on floor, weight of body in chair, hands on thighs. Name what you're touching (silently or aloud).
5. **Check:** Has your state shifted? Usually, even small shift is noticeable.

**Physiological explanation:**
- The slow orientation tells your brainstem "no predator present"
- Extended exhale stimulates the vagus nerve, slowing heart rate
- Physical grounding brings attention to body, out of spinning thoughts

**If 90 seconds isn't enough:**
- Repeat the cycle
- Add cold water on wrists or face (cold activates dive reflex, slows heart)
- Add humming or singing (vibrates vagus nerve)

---

### Post-Day Clearing

**When:** Each evening before rest—at least 15 minutes before bed

**Purpose:** To discharge what you absorbed, clear before sleep, wake cleaner

**How:**
1. Sit or lie down. Close eyes.
2. Scan body and field for heaviness, tension, or unfamiliarity. Where did the day land?
3. Ask: "What am I carrying that isn't mine?" Wait for the body to answer. Don't think—feel.
4. With each exhale, release what isn't yours. Imagine it leaving through your skin, returning to the earth.
5. Continue until lighter. May take 5-10 breaths, may take 20.
6. When clearer, hand on chest: *"What remains is mine. I rest in myself."*
7. If anything needs processing (yours, not absorbed), acknowledge it: "I see you. I'll attend to you. Not tonight."
8. Sleep.

**Common issues:**
- **Can't release:** Sometimes you need to process before releasing. Journal briefly before this practice.
- **Fall asleep during:** That's okay. Your system needed rest more than clearing.
- **Feel more activated:** You may have stirred up something that needs attention. Ground first, then journal.

---

### Morning Anchor

**When:** When you wake already anxious, spinning, or activated

**Purpose:** To establish ground before the day starts

**How:**
1. Before getting up, place both hands on your belly.
2. Feel the weight of your hands. Feel your breath moving under them.
3. Say internally: *"I am here. In this body. In this moment. The day hasn't started yet. Right now, I am safe."*
4. Take 5 slow breaths, feeling belly rise and fall.
5. Before rising, set one intention for the day—keep it simple: "Today I stay grounded." "Today I notice my body." "Today I don't absorb."
6. Rise slowly.

---

## Extended Practices (5-15 Minutes)

### Pre-Conversation Protocol

**When:** Before a difficult conversation, meeting with a challenging person, or entering a charged situation

**Purpose:** To establish your field before contact so you don't absorb or collapse

**How:**
1. **Clear:** Spend 60 seconds releasing any residual activation from before. Don't enter already loaded.
2. **Scan:** Where is your body right now? Where is tension? Breathe into it.
3. **Intention:** "I enter this conversation in my own field. I can be present without absorbing. I can speak truth without requiring agreement."
4. **Boundary:** Visualize your field boundary—not a wall, but a semi-permeable membrane. You can see and feel what's happening without it entering you.
5. **Ground:** Feel feet, feel seat, feel breath. Establish contact with present moment.
6. **Enter.**

**During the conversation:**
- Check periodically: "Am I still in my own field?"
- If you notice absorption: silent "return to sender"
- If you notice activation: longer exhale, feel feet
- If you need to pause: "Give me a moment to think about that"

---

### Contact Recovery

**When:** Just left a difficult person, draining meeting, or challenging family gathering

**Purpose:** To clear what you absorbed before it settles

**How:**
1. Find a private space (bathroom works fine).
2. **Shake:** Literally shake your body for 30 seconds. Arms, legs, shoulders. Animals do this after threat—it discharges activation.
3. **Breathe:** 5 long exhales, releasing everything with the breath.
4. **Clear:** "I release everything that is not mine. I return to my own field."
5. **Separate:** "What happened there is theirs. I don't need to carry it."
6. **Ground:** Feel feet. Look around slowly. Orient to present space.
7. **Check:** What's still mine? If something of yours needs attention, note it. Attend later.

**If you can't shake (public space):**
- Clench and release fists under table
- Press feet firmly into floor, release
- Long exhales with sighing sound (quietly)

---

### Cord Check Protocol

**When:** Weekly, or when feeling energetically drained without clear cause, or when you can't stop thinking about someone

**Purpose:** To identify and release unhealthy energetic attachments

**How:**
1. Sit quietly. Close eyes.
2. Scan for where attention is going:
   - Who are you thinking about without choosing to?
   - Who pulls at your energy when they're not present?
   - Who do you feel even when they're not in the room?
3. For each cord, ask:
   - Is this nourishing or draining?
   - Is this appropriate to the relationship?
   - Am I attached, or am I entangled?
4. For draining or inappropriate cords, use release practice:
   - *"I release this attachment to its right size. I am connected but not entangled. I have my energy. They have theirs."*
   - Visualize the cord softening, finding its appropriate length—not cut, but right-sized
5. Breathe. Feel the space that returns.

**Important:**
- Not all cords are bad. Healthy connection creates healthy cords.
- You're not cutting connection—you're right-sizing it
- Some cords reform quickly. This is maintenance, not one-time fix.

**Specific cord releases:**

For family: *"I release the role I was assigned. I am connected by love, not by obligation. I return to my own ground."*

For ex-partners: *"What we shared stays between us. I release what I'm carrying for you. We go forward in our own lives."*

For those who drain: *"I release the pattern of over-giving. My energy is mine. Yours is yours."*

---

### Digital Audit

**When:** Weekly—set a specific day

**Purpose:** To clean your digital environment the way you clean physical space

**How:**
1. **Review:** What did I consume digitally this week? Social media, news, YouTube, podcasts, emails.
2. **Notice:** What groups/accounts/follows consistently leave me feeling worse? What's the emotional residue of my digital intake?
3. **Clean:** Mute, unfollow, unsubscribe, leave as needed. Be ruthless.
4. **Boundary:** Set one digital boundary for next week:
   - No phone first 30 minutes of day
   - One specific platform only during specific hours
   - Notification restrictions
   - Night mode at specific time
5. **Replace:** What would be nourishing? What replaces the draining input?

**Digital hygiene questions:**
- Does this account/group nourish or drain me?
- Does this information serve my life or just activate my nervous system?
- Am I consuming or being consumed?
- Is this connection or compulsion?

---

### Evening Release Ritual

**When:** When you can't sleep and your mind is spinning, processing, or rehearsing

**Purpose:** To discharge the day so sleep is possible

**How:**
1. Sit on edge of bed or in chair.
2. **Body scan:** Move attention slowly from head to feet. Notice where the day lodged.
3. **Name and release:** "I release the conversation with [name]." "I release the task I couldn't finish." "I release the worry about tomorrow."
4. **Physical release:** Shake hands and arms. Roll shoulders. Let tension exit.
5. **Transfer:** If thoughts need capturing, write them on paper. "I give this to the paper. It holds it until morning."
6. **Boundary:** *"The day is complete. What remains waits until tomorrow. Tonight, I rest."*
7. **Ground in bed:** Feel weight of body on mattress. Feel covers. Feel breath. This is all that's real right now.

## Weekly Practices (20-60 Minutes)

### Weekly Hygiene Practice (Choose One)

The specific practice matters less than the consistency. Pick what works for you:

**Extended meditation or body scan (20-30 min)**

- If emotions arise, let them move
- End with 5 minutes of natural breath

---

### Weekly Review Practice

Once weekly, answer these questions in writing:

1. **Field quality:** How clean was my field this week? What did I absorb? What lingered?

2. **Pattern check:** Did old identity patterns activate? When? What triggered them?

3. **Boundary inventory:** Which boundaries held? Which softened? What needs reinforcement?

4. **Energy audit:** Where did I spend energy wisely? Where did I leak or over-give?

5. **Regulation score:** How often was I regulated vs. activated vs. collapsed?

6. **Relationship review:** Which relationships nourished? Which depleted?

7. **Next week:** What does next week need from me? What practice to emphasize?

---

## Monthly Practices (2+ Hours)

### Full Hygiene Reset

**Schedule this in advance. Treat it as non-negotiable maintenance.**

**Elements to include:**

1. **Physical space clearing:** Clean and reset your environment. Clutter in space = clutter in field. Pay special attention to bedroom and workspace.

2. **Digital reset:** Major audit. Unsubscribe from email lists. Leave dormant group chats. Unfollow accounts that drain. Organize files. Clear downloads folder.

3. **Cord inventory:** Full review of all significant relationships. Use cord check protocol for each. Right-size attachments.

4. **Longer practice:** Extended meditation (45+ min), retreat day, or extended nature time. Go deeper than weekly practice allows.

5. **Pattern review:** What patterns ran this month? What needs attention? What's shifting?

6. **Body care:** Massage, acupuncture, float tank, sauna—physical reset complements energetic reset.

7. **Intention setting:** What does next month need? What am I practicing?

---

### Monthly Relationship Audit

**For each significant relationship:**

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Do I feel more me around them, or less? | |
| Is the energy mutual, or draining? | |
| Are my boundaries respected? | |
| Can we hold difference? | |
| Is this relationship requiring self-abandonment? | |
| **Decision:** Continue / Adjust / Reduce / End | |

**After completing:**
- What adjustments need to be made?
- What conversations need to happen?
- What boundaries need reinforcement?
- What distance needs to increase?

## Emergency Practices (Under 2 Minutes)

### When Flooding

You're overwhelmed, can't think clearly, emotions are taking over.

1. **Name it:** "I'm flooding." Naming creates tiny distance.
2. **Ground immediately:** Feet hard on floor. Hand on surface. Name 5 things you can see.
3. **Breathe:** Long exhales. 4 counts in, 8 counts out.
4. **Orient:** Look around slowly. Let eyes land on different objects. There is no predator here.
5. **Delay:** Don't act from flood. "I'll decide when I'm regulated."

**The key:** Don't try to process while flooded. Regulate first. Think later.

---

### When Absorbing

You've taken on someone else's energy—their mood, anxiety, or pain is now in you.

1. **Notice:** "This isn't mine." The noticing is crucial.
2. **Separate:** "I can feel this without becoming it."
3. **Breathe:** Create space in the body with breath.
4. **Release:** "Return to sender" with each exhale.
5. **Return:** Come back to your own body. Your own sensations. Your own ground.

---

### When Activated Before Speaking

You're about to respond from activation, not from ground.

1. **Pause:** Don't respond yet. One breath.
2. **Ground:** Feet. Seat. Breath.
3. **Check:** What state am I in? Is this activation or clarity?
4. **Regulate:** 3-5 slow breaths. Longer exhale.
5. **Ask:** What do I actually want to say? What serves?
6. **Speak:** From regulation, not activation. Slower than feels natural.

---

### 30-Second Emergency Ground

When you have almost no time and need to shift state immediately.

1. Press feet hard into floor. Feel the ground.
2. One long exhale with audible sigh.
3. Name where you are: "I am in [location]."
4. Place hand on chest. Feel heartbeat.
5. Say internally: "I am here. Right now. That's all."

## Practice Stacking

Combine practices for deeper effect:

**Morning Stack (5 min):**
- 60-Second Field Scan
- Pre-Day Seal
- State check + intention

**Evening Stack (10 min):**
- Post-Day Clearing
- Cord check (brief)
- Gratitude for one sovereign moment
- Evening release if needed

**Weekly Stack (1 hour):**
- Cord check protocol (full)
- Digital audit

---

## Customizing Your Menu

Not every day needs every practice. Build your own routine:

**Minimum daily (6 min):**
Pre-day seal (1 min) + post-day clearing (5 min)

**Standard daily (15 min):**
Add morning anchor (3 min) + field scan (1 min) + one reset as needed (5 min)

**Full daily (25 min):**
All practices as needed, including pre-conversation protocols

**Weekly (1-2 hours):**
Cord check + digital audit + extended practice + review

**Monthly (4+ hours):**
Full reset + relationship audit + longer retreat/practice

---

## Building the Habit

Start with minimum. Build from there.

**Week 1-2:** Pre-day seal + post-day clearing only. Get these solid.

**Week 3-4:** Add morning anchor or field scan. Choose based on your pattern.

**Month 2:** Add weekly practice. One extended practice per week.

**Month 3:** Add monthly reset. Schedule it in advance.

**Ongoing:** Adjust based on what you need. The menu is here to serve you.

---

## Signs You Need More Hygiene

- Consistently exhausted without physical cause
- Carrying others' moods even when you don't want to
- Difficulty knowing what's yours vs. others'
- Boundary fatigue (saying no takes heroic effort)
- Persistent cord connections (can't stop thinking about someone)
- Digital overwhelm increasing
- Field feels cluttered, dense, or defended
- Sleep disrupted without clear cause
- Emotional reactivity increasing

**When these appear:** Increase your hygiene practices. You need more maintenance, not less.

---

*"I don't need protection. I need to remember to clean."*
