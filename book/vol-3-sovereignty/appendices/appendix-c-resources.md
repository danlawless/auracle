## Community and Connection

### Building Sovereign Community

Sovereignty isn't isolation. It includes learning to be in community while maintaining your center.

**Look for:**
- Groups where your boundaries are respected
- Spaces where you can practice being seen
- Communities that celebrate differentiation
- People who are also doing their work

**Avoid:**
- Groups that require conformity for belonging
- Communities that use shame as a bonding mechanism
- Spaces where you consistently lose yourself
- Relationships that feel like energy drains

## A Note on Resources

Resources are tools, not saviors.

The goal isn't to find the right book, the right therapist, or the right practice that will finally fix you.

The goal is to support the work you're already doing—returning to yourself, trusting your own authority, and living from your own center.

Take what serves. Leave what doesn't. Trust yourself to know the difference.
