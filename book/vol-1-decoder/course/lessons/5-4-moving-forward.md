### Script

You've done the learning. Now comes the living.

This lesson is about what happens next—the reality of moving forward and how to navigate it.

**The reality of moving forward**

I want to be honest with you about what lies ahead.

**Recovery is not linear.** You'll have good days and hard days. You'll catch patterns instantly sometimes and miss them other times. That's normal. Progress is measured in months and years, not hours and days.

**Insight isn't enough.** Understanding what happened cognitively doesn't automatically change your nervous system. You'll need to practice the somatic tools consistently. The body holds patterns that the mind alone cannot release.

**The urge to return may arise.** Especially if you're fresh out of a manipulation dynamic, the trauma bond will pull. You may idealize what you left. You may minimize what happened. Document your experience now, while you're clear, so you can remind yourself later when you're foggy.

**New patterns take time.** The decoder skills become automatic with practice, but at first they require conscious effort. Keep using the cards. Keep running the protocol. Speed will come.

**You may encounter more narcissists.** Now that you know the patterns, you'll recognize them everywhere—in old relationships you hadn't assessed clearly, in new people you meet. This is disconcerting at first. It's also protection.

**Practical next steps**

Here's what I suggest for your immediate future:

**1. Review the materials.** Go through the Decoder Cards again. Reread your exercises. Let the patterns settle deeper.

**2. Practice daily.** Do your nervous system practices every day. Even 5 minutes makes a difference.

**3. Apply in real-time.** Use the Decoder Protocol in your life. Start with lower-stakes situations and build up.

**4. Build support.** Find people who understand what you've experienced. Therapy, support groups, trusted friends. You don't have to do this alone.

**5. Document your journey.** Keep a journal. Track patterns. Celebrate progress. Have a record for when you need reminding.

**6. Be patient.** Deep healing takes time. Trust the process. You're on the right path.

**You're not alone**

Many people have walked this path before you. Many are walking it right now.

The confusion you felt was real. The patterns were real. The harm was real.

And so is your recovery.

In our next lesson, we'll close this course with a celebration of what you've accomplished and a look at what's ahead.

For now, let this land: You have what you need. The rest is practice.
