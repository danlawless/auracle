## A Note Before You Begin

> *You feel called to help.*
>
> *Maybe it's because you know what it's like to be in the dark. Maybe it's because someone helped you, and you want to pass that forward. Maybe people just show up at your door with their pain, and you've never known how to turn them away.*
>
> *This book is not here to tell you to stop helping.*
>
> *It's here to teach you how to help without disappearing.*
>
> *Because the world needs guides who are grounded, boundaried, and sustainable. Not martyrs who burn out. Not rescuers who need to be needed. Not wounded healers hiding in the role.*
>
> *Your healing is your credential. Your boundaries are your offering.*
