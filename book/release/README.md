```

**The funnel:**
1. Social content → Substack signup
2. Substack → Free Decoder Cards (email capture)
3. Email list → Book purchases
4. Book readers → Future offerings (coaching, courses, community)

---

## Key Metrics to Track

**First 90 Days:**
- 25+ Amazon reviews on Volume 1
- 500+ email subscribers
- 1 podcast appearance

**First 6 Months:**
- 100+ Amazon reviews across both books
- 2,000+ email subscribers
- Waitlist for coaching/course offering

---

## Platform Strategy

| Platform | Role | Priority |
|----------|------|----------|
| Amazon KDP | Discovery + credibility | High |
| Gumroad | Direct sales + email capture | High |
| Substack | Newsletter + community hub | High |
| Instagram/TikTok | Content distribution | Medium |

**Key insight:** Amazon drives discovery but captures no emails. Gumroad has no discovery but captures emails. Use both strategically.

---

## Content Repurposing

Each book chapter generates 4-6 weeks of content:

```
Chapter → Newsletter → 3-5 Social Posts → Video Script (optional)
```

Total content potential:
- Vol 1: 11 chapters + 2 appendices = ~60+ weeks of content
- Vol 2: 25 chapters + 3 appendices = ~120+ weeks of content

You'll never run out of content.

## Remember

**The books are not the product. The books are the proof.**

Every piece of content should:
1. Demonstrate expertise (build trust)
2. Capture an email (build asset)
3. Help someone heal (build loyalty)

Future offerings—coaching, courses, community—are the long-term product. The books establish you as the authority who can deliver them.

## Next Steps

1. Start with `01-platform-setup-guide.md`
2. Work through files in order
3. Launch Volume 1
4. Run content calendar
5. Launch Volume 2
6. Begin planning future offerings

You've got this.
