### Script

You've come so far.

This is the end of Course 1: The Narcissism Decoder. Take a moment to acknowledge what you've accomplished.

When you started this course, you may have felt confused, doubting yourself, wondering if you were crazy.

Now you have language for what happened. You have tools for what's happening. You have a path forward.

**What you've built**

Let's take inventory:

**Recognition skills.** You understand the invisible architecture of manipulation. You can feel it in your body. You know the tactics and can name them.

**Understanding.** You know why these patterns hooked you—not because of weakness, but because of healthy human attachment. You understand trauma bonds, family roles, and the systems that shape these dynamics.

**Tools.** You have the Decoder Cards. You have the 3-3-3 Rule. You have the 4-step Decoder Protocol. You have practical scripts. You have the Exposure Questions. You have nervous system practices.

**Clarity.** Most importantly, you have clarity. You trust your perception again. You know what you experienced. The confusion that was deliberately created is lifting.

**A final word**

Before we close, I want to speak directly to you.

You picked up this course because something felt off. You trusted that feeling enough to seek understanding.

That took courage.

Many people stay confused forever. Many people believe the manipulator's narrative. Many people never find the language for what happened to them.

You did. You're here.

The confusion is ending. The clarity is building. The path forward is becoming visible.

You were not too sensitive.
You were not crazy.
You were not the problem.

Let that land.

What happened to you was real. The patterns were real. The harm was real.

And so is your recovery.

Let that land.

The manipulation taught you that your perception couldn't be trusted. But here's the truth: your perception was correct all along. You knew something was wrong. You just didn't have the words.

Now you do.

Let that land.

Take these truths with you. Let them anchor you:

Your perception is valid.
Your boundaries are allowed.
Your peace is worth protecting.
Your life is yours to live.

**What's next**

The full journey from survival to sovereignty includes more stages:

- **HEAL** — Retraining your nervous system for secure attachment
- **STAND** — Installing internal authority
- **LIVE** — Embodying presence in your body
- **GIVE** — Breaking generational patterns
- **SERVE** — Holding space for others
- **THRIVE** — Building material prosperity
- **BECOME** — Stepping into your full expression

If you're ready to continue, Course 2: The Bridge picks up where this course ends—retraining your nervous system for secure attachment, understanding why insight alone isn't enough, and building the bridge from trauma to trust.

**Closing**

Until then, practice what you've learned. Trust what you know.

Remember: you were never crazy. You were just confused—exactly as they intended.

The confusion ends here.

Welcome home to yourself.
