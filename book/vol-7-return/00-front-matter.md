## A Note Before You Begin

> *You've done the inner work.*
>
> *You can name the patterns. You've healed the nervous system. You've installed sovereignty. You've begun to inhabit your presence.*
>
> *But something is still missing.*
>
> *Maybe it's the career you lost to the relationship. Maybe it's the savings that were drained. Maybe it's the scarcity that still lives in your body, even when the bank account says otherwise.*
>
> *This book is about the return.*
>
> *Not returning to who you were before — that person is gone. But returning to the world with your whole self. Building a life that matches the healing you've done. Letting your outer world catch up to your inner one.*
>
> *You are allowed to thrive. Not just survive.*
