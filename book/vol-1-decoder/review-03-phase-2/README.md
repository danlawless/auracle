# Phase 2: Content & Experience Review

**Volume:** Vol. 1: The Narcissism Decoder
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Date Initiated:** January 4, 2026

---

## Phase 2 Overview

Phase 2 focuses on **content quality and reader experience** now that Phase 1 structural decisions are complete. Three reviewers work in parallel:

| Reviewer | Role | Questions | Focus |
|----------|------|-----------|-------|
| **Bailey** | Beta Reader | 56 | Reader engagement, pacing, clarity, emotional impact |
| **Sage** | Sensitivity Reader | 18 | Representation, inclusion, cultural considerations |
| **Felix** | Fact-Checker | 6 | Verification, sources, accuracy |

**Total Phase 2 Questions: 80**

---

## Why These Run in Parallel

Unlike Phase 1 (where structural decisions affected everything else), Phase 2 reviewers address independent concerns:

- **Bailey** asks: "Does this engage and serve readers?"
- **Sage** asks: "Does this represent diverse communities respectfully?"
- **Felix** asks: "Is this accurate and properly sourced?"

Changes from one reviewer don't invalidate another's work.

- **High Priority:** Q10 (No contact alternatives), Q15 (Economic privilege), Q17 (Accessibility)

### Felix (Fact-Checker) — 6 Questions
- **Must Fix:** Gloria Steinem quote (2 locations) — can proceed without author input

## Timeline Expectation

Phase 2 can be completed in 1-2 sessions depending on how thoroughly you want to engage with each question. Many questions have clear preferred answers; others invite deeper reflection.

**Recommended approach:**
1. Scan all questions first
2. Answer obvious/quick decisions immediately
3. Mark questions needing reflection
4. Return to reflection questions

## What Happens After Phase 2

Once Phase 2 is complete:

1. **Implement approved changes** from Bailey, Sage, Felix responses
2. **Apply required corrections** (Gloria Steinem quote, etc.)
3. **Move to Phase 3:** Line editing (Lydia) then Copy editing (Clara)
4. **Phase 4:** Final proofreading (Petra)
