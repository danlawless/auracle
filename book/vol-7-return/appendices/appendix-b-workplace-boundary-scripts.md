# Appendix B: Workplace Boundary Scripts

## Language for Navigating Professional Dynamics After Trauma

---

For those who survived narcissistic dynamics, the workplace can feel like a minefield.

You may recognize manipulation faster than others. You may also freeze when it happens. You may over-explain, over-apologize, or over-accommodate—because that's what kept you safe before.

These scripts are not about becoming cold or disconnected. They're about having language ready so you can respond from choice instead of old programming.

**A note before you begin:** Workplace boundaries are contextual. What works with a peer may not work with a CEO. What's appropriate in a startup may differ from a corporate environment. Adapt these scripts to your situation, your culture, and your nervous system's capacity.

---

## How to Use These Scripts

1. **Read them aloud.** Notice which feel natural and which feel impossible.
2. **Identify your patterns.** Which situations trigger you most?
3. **Practice when calm.** These scripts work best when they're already in your body.
4. **Start small.** Begin with lower-stakes situations.
5. **Adapt to your voice.** Keep the structure, change the words.

---

## The Core Principle

The goal is not to win arguments or prove points. The goal is to:

- Maintain your dignity
- Protect your nervous system
- Stay employed (when that's your goal)
- Build a reputation as professional, not pushover

**Sovereign language is:**
- Clear, not aggressive
- Boundaried, not defensive
- Brief, not over-explained
- Firm, not rigid

# Part I: General Workplace Boundaries

## Setting Limits on Your Time

### When Asked to Take on Extra Work

**If you can do it:**
"I can take that on. To do it well, I'll need to push back [other task] to [new deadline]. Does that work?"

**If you can't:**
"My plate is full with [current priorities]. I won't be able to take that on this week."

"That's not something I can absorb right now. Who else might be able to help?"

"I'd need to drop something else to do that justice. What would you like me to deprioritize?"

### When Expected to Work Late or Weekends

**Setting the boundary:**
"I have a commitment tonight and won't be available after 6."

"I protect my weekends for family/rest. I'll address this first thing Monday."

"I'm not available this weekend. If it's urgent, we'll need to find another solution."

**When it's presented as "everyone does it":**
"I understand the culture here involves long hours. I'm committed to doing excellent work during work hours. That's what you can count on from me."

### When Interrupted During Focus Time

"I'm in the middle of something—can we talk at 2?"

"I block this time for focused work. I'm available after 3."

"Let me finish this thought and I'll come find you."

---

## Handling Criticism and Feedback

### When Receiving Valid Feedback

**What to say:**
"Thank you for that feedback. I'll take that into account."

"I appreciate you telling me. Can you give me a specific example so I understand better?"

"That's helpful. I'm going to sit with that and think about how to apply it."

**What NOT to say:**
- Excessive apology
- Immediate justification
- Promise to be perfect

### When Receiving Harsh or Unfair Criticism

**Buying time:**
"I need some time to process that. Can we revisit this tomorrow?"

"I hear your concern. I'd like to respond thoughtfully rather than reactively."

**Addressing the delivery:**
"I'm open to feedback. I receive it better when it's delivered [calmly/privately/with specifics]."

"I can hear there's a concern here. The way it's being expressed makes it hard to take in."

**When publicly criticized:**
"Let's take this offline and discuss privately."

"I'd prefer not to have this conversation in front of others."

---

## Saying No

### To a Peer

"That's not going to work for me."

"I'm going to pass on that."

"I appreciate you thinking of me, but no."

### To a Manager

"Given my current workload, I can't take that on without sacrificing quality on [other project]."

"I want to be realistic—that's not achievable in that timeframe."

"Let me show you what's on my plate. Help me prioritize what you'd like me to focus on."

### To a Request You Don't Want to Explain

"That doesn't work for me."

"I'm not available for that."

"I'll have to decline."

**You don't owe an explanation.** A simple no, delivered calmly, is complete.

---

## Handling Questions You Don't Want to Answer

### Personal Questions

"I keep my personal life pretty private at work."

"I'd rather not get into that here."

"That's personal—I'm going to keep that to myself."

### Salary/Compensation Questions from Peers

"I don't share my salary information."

"I prefer to keep compensation private."

Or, if you choose to share (legal in the US and can benefit workers):
"I'm comfortable sharing—I make [X]. It's useful to know where we stand."

### Invasive Questions About Your Past

"I don't discuss that at work."

"That's not something I share professionally."

"I prefer to focus on the present."

# Part II: Navigating Difficult People

## The Credit-Taker

*Someone who takes credit for your work*

### In the Moment

"Just to be clear, I developed that proposal. I'm glad it's being well received."

"That was actually my project. I'm happy to share more about my process."

### Preventatively

- Document your contributions in writing
- Send updates directly to stakeholders
- Use "I" statements in meetings: "I completed the analysis and found..."
- Follow up meetings with email summaries of who did what

### To Your Manager

"I want to make sure my contributions are visible. The [project] was my work, though I noticed [colleague] presented it as theirs. How can I ensure proper attribution going forward?"

---

## The Underminer

*Someone who subtly (or not subtly) undermines you*

### When Corrected Publicly

"I stand by my approach. I'm happy to discuss your concerns after the meeting."

"We see this differently. I'd like to understand your perspective—let's talk offline."

### When Excluded from Important Conversations

"I noticed I wasn't included in that meeting. Can you help me understand why?"

"For decisions that affect my area, I need to be in the room."

### When Receiving Backhanded Compliments

"I'm not sure how to take that. Can you clarify what you mean?"

Simply don't respond. A confused look can be powerful.

---

## The Micromanager

*Someone who can't let you work autonomously*

### Setting Expectations

"I work best when I have space to execute. Can we agree on check-in points rather than constant oversight?"

"I'm confident in my ability to handle this. I'll flag any issues proactively."

"What would help you feel comfortable giving me more autonomy here?"

### When Being Over-Monitored

"I've got this under control. I'll come to you if I need guidance."

"I appreciate your involvement, and I also need space to work."

"Let's set up a weekly check-in instead of daily. That will be more efficient for both of us."

---

## The Boundary-Crosser

*Someone who doesn't respect professional boundaries*

### Physical Boundaries

"I prefer not to be touched."

"I'm going to step back—I need more personal space."

"Please don't do that."

### Time Boundaries

"I have a hard stop at 5 today."

"I'm not checking messages after hours. I'll respond in the morning."

"I need to leave this conversation now."

### Emotional Boundaries

"I'm not the right person to vent to about this."

"That feels like more than I can hold at work."

"I care about you, and I'm not able to be your support person here."

---

## The Narcissistic Colleague or Boss

*When you recognize the patterns*

**Remember:** You cannot change them. You can only manage your own responses and protect yourself.

### Core Strategies

1. **Document everything.** Email confirmations of verbal conversations.
2. **Don't challenge their ego publicly.** It never ends well.
3. **Stay neutral and factual.** Gray rock at work.
4. **Build relationships with others.** Don't let them isolate you.
5. **Know your exit options.** Start looking before you're desperate.

### Scripts for Narcissistic Patterns

**When they're taking credit:**
Document your work. Don't confront directly—it escalates. Share your contributions through other channels.

**When they're gaslighting:**
"That's not my recollection. I have it documented differently. Let me pull that up."

"I remember that conversation differently. Good thing I sent that email summary."

**When they're raging:**
"I can see you're upset. I'm going to give you some space. We can revisit this when things are calmer."

"I'm not going to continue this conversation while you're shouting."

**When they're love-bombing:**
Stay neutral. Don't reciprocate excessive praise. Watch for what follows.

**When they're triangulating:**
"I'd prefer to hear concerns about my work directly from [person], not through you."

"I'm not going to discuss [colleague] with you. That's between you and them."

---

# Part III: Meetings and Visibility

## Being Heard in Meetings

### When Interrupted

"I'd like to finish my thought."

"Let me complete my point."

"I was speaking."

### When Your Idea is Later Credited to Someone Else

"I'm glad that idea is resonating. I mentioned it earlier—let me expand on it."

"Thanks for building on what I said. I'd like to add..."

### When You Need to Speak Up

"I have a perspective I'd like to share."

"Before we move on, I want to add something."

"I disagree, and here's why."

### When You Don't Know the Answer

"I don't have that information right now. I'll follow up by end of day."

"That's outside my area of expertise. [Name] would be better to answer that."

"Good question. Let me look into it and get back to you."

---

## Managing Your Visibility

### Sharing Accomplishments Without Bragging

"I wanted to let you know that [project] came in on time and under budget."

"I'm proud of how [result] turned out. Here's what I learned in the process."

"The client gave positive feedback on my work—thought you'd want to know."

### When Asked to Promote Yourself

"I led the [project], which resulted in [outcome]."

"My contribution was [specific thing]. It impacted [result]."

Focus on facts and results, not feelings or qualifiers.

### Asking for What You've Earned

"Based on my contributions over the past year, I'd like to discuss a raise."

"I've been performing at [next level]. I'd like to talk about a promotion."

"My research shows this role pays [X] in the market. I'd like to discuss adjusting my compensation."

---

# Part IV: Sensitive Situations

## Handling Harassment

### First Occurrence (If It Feels Safe)

"That comment was inappropriate. Please don't say that again."

"That makes me uncomfortable. Stop."

"That's not okay. I need you to not do that."

### Documenting

- Date, time, location
- Exactly what was said/done
- Any witnesses
- How you responded
- How you felt (for context)

### Reporting

"I need to report an incident of harassment. Can you tell me the formal process?"

"I want this documented. Please confirm in writing that I've reported this."

### If You're Not Believed

"I understand you haven't witnessed this. That doesn't mean it didn't happen. I need to know what protections are available to me."

---

## Navigating Workplace Politics

### When Asked to Take Sides

"I'm not getting involved in this."

"I have good relationships with everyone and I'd like to keep it that way."

"That's between you and them."

### When Others Are Gossiping

"I'm not comfortable talking about [person] when they're not here."

"I don't have insight into that situation."

Change the subject or exit gracefully.

### When You're the Target of Politics

- Document facts
- Build alliances with ethical colleagues
- Don't retaliate in kind
- Consider whether this workplace is worth your energy

---

## Discussing Accommodations

### Mental Health Accommodations

"I'd like to discuss an accommodation under ADA. What's the process?"

"I have a health condition that requires [specific accommodation]. Here's documentation from my provider."

You are not required to disclose your diagnosis—only that you have a condition requiring accommodation.

### Flexibility Requests

"I'm requesting [work from home/flexible hours] because [brief reason if you choose to share]."

"This accommodation would allow me to perform at my best."

---

# Part V: Leaving Well

## Giving Notice

### The Script

"I'm resigning from my position, effective [date]. I'm grateful for [genuine positive]. I'm moving on to [general description if you want to share]."

Keep it brief. Don't vent. Don't explain.

### In Writing

A resignation letter should include:
- Clear statement of resignation
- Last day of work
- Brief thanks (optional but professional)
- Offer to help with transition (optional)

### If Asked Why You're Leaving

"I'm pursuing a new opportunity that's the right next step for me."

"It's time for a change. I'm grateful for my time here."

You don't owe anyone the full truth.

---

## Exit Interview

### What to Share

Share only what might help the next person. Avoid:
- Venting
- Personal attacks
- Burning bridges

**Example:**
"The culture could benefit from [specific, constructive feedback]."

"I found [specific thing] challenging. It might help retention to address that."

### What Not to Share

- Detailed complaints that won't lead to change
- Information that could harm you professionally
- Anything you wouldn't want repeated

---

# Part VI: Integration Principles

## Before You Speak

Ask yourself:

1. **Is this my boundary to set?** (Or am I overstepping?)
2. **What's my nervous system doing?** (Regulated or activated?)
3. **What outcome do I want?** (Clear goal)
4. **Is this worth the relational cost?** (Pick your battles)
5. **Am I protecting myself or performing?** (Check motives)

---

## When Boundaries Feel Impossible

### Signs You're Activated

- Heart racing
- Words won't come
- Freeze response
- Over-explaining
- Wanting to cry
- Rage that feels disproportionate

### What to Do

1. **Buy time.** "Let me think about that."
2. **Exit if needed.** "I'll be right back."
3. **Regulate.** Breath, feet on floor, cold water.
4. **Return when ready.** Or don't—sometimes silence is the boundary.

---

## Anchor Phrases for Work

- *"I can be clear without being unkind."*
- *"Professional means boundaried, not boundaryless."*
- *"My job is not to manage everyone's feelings."*
- *"I can disagree and still belong."*
- *"Boundaries protect my longevity here."*
- *"I don't have to explain myself to be valid."*

---

## Creating Your Own Scripts

Use this template for situations you encounter:

**Situation:** [What happens]

**Old pattern:** [How I used to respond]

**Sovereign response:** [What I'll say now]

**If they push back:** [My follow-up]

**Anchor phrase:** [My reminder]

---

## A Note on Power Dynamics

These scripts assume a certain level of safety and privilege. If:

- Your job is precarious
- You're in a hostile environment
- You're facing discrimination
- You have no safety net

...then self-protection may mean silence. That's not failure. That's survival.

Sometimes the most sovereign thing you can do is keep your head down while you plan your exit.

There is no shame in strategic compliance while you build your escape.

---

*"I am allowed to protect my peace at work. Professionalism doesn't mean self-abandonment."*
