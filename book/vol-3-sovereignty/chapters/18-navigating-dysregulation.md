# Chapter 18: Navigating Others' Dysregulation

## When They Haven't Done the Work

---

You've done the work.

You've named your patterns. You've trained your nervous system. You've built internal authority.

And now you're in rooms, relationships, and families with people who haven't.

This is where sovereignty gets practical.

**How do you stay regulated in the presence of dysregulation—without absorbing, fixing, or abandoning?**

This is perhaps the most demanding test of everything you've learned.

## Field Note (Before): The Emotional Firefighter

His friend is spiraling.

Before he can think, he's in problem-solving mode. Offering advice. Managing the crisis. Staying calm so they don't have to.

He can feel the familiar tightening in his chest—the signal that he's taking on something that isn't his. But he doesn't stop. He can't stop. Stopping feels like abandonment.

Hours later, he's exhausted—and he hasn't said a word about his own day. He drove thirty minutes to be here, cancelled plans, and now he's sitting in his car in the parking lot, too drained to drive home.

He can't figure out why he keeps losing himself. Why his friendships always feel like rescue missions. Why being "the strong one" leaves him so depleted.

He knows this pattern. He just doesn't know how to break it.

---

## Field Note (After): The Witness

His friend is spiraling.

He notices the pull. The urgency. The familiar impulse to step in, solve, fix, rescue.

He breathes. He feels his feet on the floor.

He listens. He nods. He doesn't interrupt with solutions.

When there's a pause, he says: "That sounds really hard."

His friend keeps talking. He doesn't fill the space. He doesn't offer fixes. He stays present without taking over.

Eventually, his friend settles. The storm passes—not because he intervened, but because he held steady while it moved through.

He didn't fix anything. He didn't absorb anything.

He witnessed—and that was enough.

And when he drives home, he still has himself.

## Field Note: The Family Dinner

She knows what's coming.

Her mother is upset about something—the way the table was set, the timing of the meal, some perceived slight that no one else can see.

The room tenses. Her father retreats. Her sister starts explaining, defending, de-escalating.

She watches herself reach for the familiar role: soothe, smooth, manage. She can feel the old choreography in her body, the steps she's danced a thousand times.

But tonight, she doesn't dance.

She stays seated. She breathes. She watches her mother's storm without stepping into it.

The discomfort is immense. Every cell in her body is screaming to fix this, to make everyone comfortable, to restore equilibrium.

She sits with it.

After dinner, her mother is still upset. Her sister is frustrated. Her father is distant.

And she—for the first time in years—is intact.

Nothing got resolved. But she didn't lose herself trying to resolve it.

## Why Dysregulated People Are Activating

Dysregulation is contagious.

When someone near you is:
- Anxious
- Angry
- Overwhelmed
- Collapsing
- Escalating
- Panicking
- Spiraling

your nervous system picks up the signal. **Mirror neurons** fire, simulating their emotional state in your own body. The **amygdala** scans for threat, uncertain whether their danger is also your danger. Stress hormones prepare you to respond—fight, flight, freeze, or fawn.

This is automatic—it's not a choice. It's how human nervous systems have been designed by millions of years of evolution. We are social creatures, and the emotions of those around us register in our bodies before we consciously perceive them.

For those trained in enmeshed or volatile environments, this contagion is stronger:
- You feel responsible for their state, as if their dysregulation is a problem you're obligated to solve
- You feel urgent to fix it, as if leaving them in distress is a moral failure
- You feel guilty if you don't engage, as if your regulation is somehow abandonment
- Your body reacts as if their emergency is your emergency, regardless of the facts
- Their discomfort becomes literally intolerable in your own body

This isn't weakness. It's training. You were conditioned to respond this way because once, it was necessary for survival.

**Sovereignty is the practice of noticing this contagion and choosing not to join it.**

## Neuroscience Lens: Regulation as Influence

Here's what research shows:

**The most regulated nervous system in the room often sets the tone.**

This is called **co-regulation**—the phenomenon whereby nervous systems in proximity influence each other. When you stay grounded while others are activated:
- Your calm becomes a reference point
- Others' nervous systems have something to regulate toward
- Urgency decreases as your steadiness provides containment
- Clarity increases when someone isn't matching the chaos

The **polyvagal system** explains this: when your vagal tone is high (indicating safety and regulation), you broadcast cues of safety to those around you. Your facial expression, your voice tone, your posture—all communicate that the environment is not as threatening as their nervous system believes.

This isn't manipulation. It's biology. Nervous systems are designed to seek regulation, and a regulated person provides an anchor.

**Key insight:** You influence others more by staying regulated than by fixing their problems. Your steadiness does more than your solutions ever could.

**Translation:** Your calm presence is the most valuable thing you can offer a dysregulated person. Not your advice. Not your solutions. Not your willingness to take on their emergency. Your regulated nervous system.

## What NOT to Do

### Don't Absorb

Taking on their emotional state as your own doesn't help them—and it depletes you.

When you absorb, you don't reduce the total amount of dysregulation in the room—you just spread it to your own body. Now there are two dysregulated people instead of one.

Signs you're absorbing:
- You feel their anxiety in your chest
- Their anger becomes your agitation
- You leave the interaction exhausted
- You can't stop thinking about their problem
- Their mood affects your mood for hours or days

**The truth:** You cannot regulate someone by becoming dysregulated with them. Absorption is not empathy—it's enmeshment.

### Don't Fix

Offering solutions when someone is flooded often escalates, not calms.

When the limbic system is activated, the prefrontal cortex (where logic and planning happen) is offline. Your brilliant solutions can't land because the part of the brain that processes solutions isn't available.

What feels like helping is often experienced as dismissing: "You shouldn't feel this way—here's how to fix it."

**The truth:** People need to feel felt before they can hear solutions. Fixing prematurely communicates: "I can't tolerate your distress."

### Don't Match

Escalating to match their energy validates the dysregulation.

If they're yelling and you yell back, you've confirmed that yelling is appropriate. If they're panicking and you panic with them, you've confirmed that panic is warranted.

Matching dysregulation doesn't create connection—it creates amplification.

### Don't Disappear

Complete withdrawal can feel like abandonment and increase their activation.

There's a difference between holding a boundary and leaving someone in crisis. Disappearing without acknowledgment can trigger abandonment wounds and intensify dysregulation.

The goal is not to abandon but to remain present without absorbing.

### Don't Take It Personally

Their dysregulation is about their nervous system, not about you.

When someone is activated, they often say things they don't mean, project onto you, or misread your intentions. This isn't about your character—it's about their state.

**The test:** Can you stay in yourself even when someone's dysregulation is directed at you?

---

## What TO Do

### Stay in Your Body

Ground. Breathe. Feel your feet on the floor. Return to yourself as often as needed.

When you notice yourself starting to absorb or react, this is your first move. Come back to your own body. Feel your hands. Notice your breath. Remind your nervous system where you end and they begin.

You may need to do this multiple times in a single interaction. That's normal.

### Witness Without Absorbing

"I see you're struggling. That sounds hard."

You acknowledge their experience without taking it on. You communicate presence without promising to fix.

Witnessing says: "I'm here with you in this." It doesn't say: "I'll take this from you."

### Offer Presence, Not Solutions

Often people need to be heard before they can hear solutions. Sometimes they never need solutions—they just need to move the emotion through their system.

Presence is: eye contact, steady breathing, open posture, silence that doesn't rush.

Presence says: "There's room for this. You're not too much."

### Set Limits If Needed

"I can be here for about 15 more minutes."
"I'm not able to talk about this right now."
"I care about you, and I need to step away."

Limits are not abandonment. They're honest acknowledgment of your capacity.

You can hold compassion and hold limits simultaneously. One does not negate the other.

### Model Regulation

Your calm is more powerful than your words.

Speak slowly. Breathe visibly. Lower your volume. Soften your face.

Your nervous system is a teaching tool. When you stay regulated, you offer a template for their nervous system to follow.

## The Empathy Trap

Highly empathic people often believe:

**"If I feel their pain, I'm showing that I care."**

This belief is understandable. It may have even been trained: perhaps the only way your pain was acknowledged was when someone else felt it with you.

But empathy without boundaries is absorption. And absorption doesn't help—it just creates two dysregulated people where before there was one.

**What absorption actually communicates:**
- "Your feelings are too big for you to handle alone"
- "I can only connect with you by joining your suffering"
- "Separation is abandonment"

**True compassion maintains distinction:**

"I can see your suffering without becoming it. I can care about your pain without carrying it. I can stay present without losing myself."

This isn't coldness. This is sustainable care. This is how you remain available instead of burned out.

**The paradox:** You're more helpful when you don't absorb. Your regulation provides a container that pure absorption cannot offer.

---

## The Mirror Neuron Challenge

Mirror neurons are why emotions spread. When you see someone in distress, neurons in your brain fire as if you were in distress yourself. This is the biological basis of empathy—and the mechanism of emotional contagion.

For those with trauma histories, mirror neurons may be hyperactive. You don't just notice others' emotions—you experience them in your own body with full intensity.

**This is not a flaw.** It may have been a survival advantage. Reading others accurately and responding immediately was protective in dangerous environments.

**But it requires management now.**

The work is not to shut down the mirror neurons—it's to add a layer of processing between perception and response. You feel the resonance AND you notice that it's resonance. You experience the pull AND you recognize it as contagion.

This awareness creates a gap. In that gap, choice lives.

## Phrases for Navigating Dysregulation

**To acknowledge without fixing:**
- "That sounds really difficult."
- "I hear you."
- "That makes sense that you'd feel that way."
- "This seems really hard right now."
- "I can see you're struggling."

**To set limits with compassion:**
- "I'm not able to be helpful right now."
- "I can listen for a few minutes, but I'm not able to problem-solve."
- "I care about you, and I need to step away."
- "I want to support you, but I'm at capacity."
- "Let's pause and come back to this later."

**To redirect toward their resources:**
- "What do you need right now?"
- "Would it help to take a breath together?"
- "Is there something specific you need from me?"
- "What's helped you with this before?"
- "Who else in your life can support you with this?"

**To exit gracefully:**
- "I need to go. I'll check in later."
- "I can see you're struggling. I don't have capacity right now, but I'll reach out tomorrow."
- "I love you. I can't do this conversation right now."
- "I'm going to step away for a bit. This doesn't mean I don't care."

## When Dysregulation Becomes Pattern

Some people are chronically dysregulated. Not occasionally struggling—persistently unable to regulate without external intervention.

They:
- Escalate frequently, with small triggers producing large reactions
- Need others to regulate them, unable to return to baseline alone
- Don't take responsibility for their state, treating emotions as things that happen to them
- Use crisis to connect, as if emergency is the only valid reason for attention
- Resist tools and strategies, remaining stuck despite offers of help
- Drain everyone around them, leaving a trail of exhausted supporters

If someone in your life fits this pattern, you have choices:

**Limit exposure:**
Reduce time, frequency, or depth of interaction. You don't need to explain or justify—you can simply be less available.

**Set clear boundaries:**
"I'm not able to be your emotional support for this."
"I can talk for 15 minutes. After that, I need to go."
"I care about you, and I can't be available every time you're struggling."

**Don't reward escalation:**
If escalation brings more attention, escalation will continue. This isn't about punishment—it's about not reinforcing patterns that harm both of you.

**Accept reality:**
They may not change. Their growth is not your responsibility. Your role is to manage your exposure, not their development.

**Consider the relationship:**
Is this relationship sustainable? Does it nourish you, or only drain you? Is there reciprocity, or only one-way giving?

These are hard questions. They're also necessary.

---

## The Fawn Response

Many people who struggle with others' dysregulation have a well-developed **fawn response**—the tendency to appease, please, and accommodate when threatened.

Unlike fight or flight, fawning keeps you close to the threat. It's a survival strategy that works through compliance: "If I make them comfortable, I'll be safe."

Signs you're in fawn response:
- You abandon your position immediately when someone is upset
- You apologize reflexively, even when you've done nothing wrong
- You feel responsible for managing everyone's emotions
- You can't tolerate anyone being uncomfortable around you
- You lose track of your own preferences in favor of others'

**The fawn response served you.** In environments where asserting yourself was dangerous, compliance was intelligent.

**But it no longer serves you.** Now, fawning keeps you trapped in one-sided relationships and prevents you from holding your own center.

Recognizing fawn is the first step. When you notice the urge to appease, you can name it: "This is fawn. I'm safe. I don't need to abandon myself."

## A Practice: The Regulation First Protocol

Use this when someone around you is dysregulated:

**Step 1: Notice your own activation.**
Where is it in your body? Name it: *"I'm getting activated."*
Don't try to talk yourself out of it—just notice it.

**Step 2: Ground before engaging.**
Three breaths. Feet on floor. Hand on chest if needed.
Return to yourself before attempting to be with them.

**Step 3: Ask yourself three questions:**
- "Is this my emergency?" (Usually, no.)
- "What's mine to do here?" (Less than you think.)
- "Can I help without absorbing?" (Only if regulated.)

**Step 4: Engage from regulation.**
Speak slowly. Lower your volume. Offer presence before solutions. Set limits as needed.

**Step 5: Discharge afterward.**
Walk. Breathe deeply. Shake off what isn't yours. Check in with your own body.

The activation you picked up isn't yours to keep. Let it move through.

---

## A Practice: The Separation Breath

When you're in the presence of someone dysregulated and feel yourself starting to absorb:

**Step 1:** Place one hand on your chest.

**Step 2:** Take a slow breath and say internally: "This is me."

**Step 3:** Exhale and say internally: "That is them."

**Step 4:** Repeat until you feel the boundary reestablish.

This simple practice reminds your nervous system where you end and they begin. It creates distinction without creating disconnection.

---

## A Practice: Post-Exposure Recovery

After extended time with a dysregulated person, you may carry their energy. Use this to discharge:

**Step 1: Acknowledge.**
"I took on something that wasn't mine."

**Step 2: Move.**
Walk, shake, stretch—move the stagnant energy through your body.

**Step 3: Cleanse.**
Shower. Wash your hands intentionally. Change clothes if needed. Use the physical as a metaphor for the energetic.

**Step 4: Refill.**
What nourishes you? Nature? Music? Silence? Give your system what it needs to return to baseline.

**Step 5: Reflect.**
What can you do differently next time? Not to blame yourself—but to learn.

## The Grief of Being Surrounded

Sometimes sovereignty means grieving that the people around you can't meet you where you are.

You've done the work. They haven't.
You can regulate. They can't.
You've changed. They've stayed the same.

This can feel:
- Lonely, like you're speaking a language no one else understands
- Frustrating, when you see patterns they can't see
- Sad, mourning the connection that could have been
- Isolating, wondering if you've grown apart from everyone

That grief is valid. And it doesn't mean you should return to old patterns to belong again.

You can grieve the gap AND stay sovereign.
You can feel lonely AND not absorb to feel connected.
You can miss how things were AND refuse to go back.

The loneliness of sovereignty is real. It's also temporary. As you hold your frequency, you'll find others who match it.

---

## When You Slip

You will absorb sometimes. You will lose yourself sometimes. You will get pulled into someone's storm and only realize it afterward.

This is not failure. This is practice.

What matters is what happens next:
- Do you notice?
- Do you return to yourself?
- Do you learn something for next time?

Sovereignty isn't perfection. It's the commitment to keep returning, no matter how many times you leave.

---

## Reader Reflection

- Who in my life is frequently dysregulated?
- How does their state affect mine?
- What would it look like to witness without absorbing?
- What limits might I need to set?
- Where do I fawn instead of hold my center?
- What's my recovery practice after exposure?

**Body cue to notice:** Urgency to fix, tightness in chest, automatic caretaking, loss of your own state

**Practice:** Regulate yourself first, then engage

---

## Integration Line

> *"I can care about you without carrying you. I can witness without absorbing."*

## Closing Note for This Chapter

You will encounter dysregulated people for the rest of your life.

In families, in workplaces, in friendships, in the world. Dysregulation is part of the human experience, and you cannot build walls high enough to avoid it entirely.

Sovereignty isn't avoiding them—it's staying yourself while being near them.

Your regulation is not a wall. It's a gift.

It gives others something to organize around.
It provides a template their nervous systems can follow.
It creates safety in spaces that feel unsafe.

And it keeps you intact.

This is the work now: to be in the world without losing yourself. To care without carrying. To witness without absorbing. To love without disappearing.

You can do this.
