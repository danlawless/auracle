### Script

The Advanced Decoder Cards cover more sophisticated manipulation tactics—the ones skilled manipulators use, and the ones that appear specifically during exit attempts.

These 18 cards complete your decoder toolkit. Some you may not have encountered yet. All are important to know.

**CARD 20: THE HOOVER**

**What they say:**
(When you try to leave): "I've changed."
"I've been in therapy."
"It'll be different this time."
"I can't live without you."
"Remember how good we were?"

**What they mean:**
"I'll say whatever it takes to restart the cycle. I need access to you."

**The function:**
Pulls you back in after you've gained distance. Resets the abuse cycle.

**Your response:**
Maintain no contact. Don't respond. If you must respond: "I wish you well. My decision stands."

---

**CARD 21: THE SMEAR**

**What they say:**
(To others, about you): "They're unstable."
"I tried everything."
"You wouldn't believe what they did."
"I'm the victim here."

**What they mean:**
"I'll destroy your reputation before you can tell your story."

**The function:**
Pre-damages your credibility. Isolates you. Creates the narrative.

**Your response:**
Don't engage with flying monkeys. Those who believe without asking you aren't safe. Focus on trustworthy people who know your truth.

---

**CARD 22: THE FUTURE FAKE**

**What they say:**
"We'll get married when..."
"Things will be better after..."
"When the kids are older..."
"In the future we'll..."

**What they mean:**
"I'll keep you invested with promises that cost me nothing now."

**The function:**
Delays your departure. Harvests your present for a future that won't come.

**Your response:**
"I'm making decisions based on the present, not promises."
Watch behavior. Stop waiting.

---

**CARD 23: THE EXTINCTION**

**What they say:**
(When they've found new supply): Complete discard. You no longer exist.
Immediate replacement.
Treating you as if the relationship never happened.

**What they mean:**
"You served your purpose. I've moved on. You should have known better than to expect more."

**The function:**
Traumatic ending that preserves their narrative. You're discarded, not released.

**Your response:**
This is about them, not you. The suddenness is proof of the pathology, not of your worthlessness. Grieve and heal.

---

**CARD 24: THE DOUBLE BIND**

**What they say:**
"Be more independent—but why aren't you thinking about me?"
"Speak up—but don't argue."
"Relax—but you're being lazy."

**What they mean:**
"Every path leads to criticism. You can't win."

**The function:**
Creates paralysis. Maintains control through impossible choices.

**Your response:**
Name it: "Both options lead to criticism. I'll make my own choice."
Stop trying to find the right answer. There isn't one.

---

**CARD 25: THE PROXY**

**What they mean:**

**The function:**
Creates pressure from multiple directions. Isolates you as the problem.

"I'm so broken."
"I'm getting worse."
"I don't know how I'll survive."

**What they mean:**
"My suffering is your responsibility. Leaving me would be cruel."

**The function:**
Creates guilt for self-protection. Makes your departure seem like an attack.

"I hope you get the help you need."
You are not their therapist. Your presence is not treatment.

**What they say:**
"If you leave, I'll..."
"You'll regret this."

"I'll make sure everyone knows."

**What they say:**
"I'll hurt myself if you leave."
"I can't go on without you."
"If something happens to me, it's your fault."

**What they mean:**
"I'll use your conscience as a prison."

**The function:**
Makes you responsible for their wellbeing. Traps you through guilt.

**Your response:**
Take it seriously: contact their support system or crisis services. But don't stay because of it. Their mental health is not your responsibility to manage through captivity.

"My lawyer will destroy you."
"I'll take everything."
"You'll never see the kids."
"I know people who can make your life difficult."

**What they mean:**
"I'll weaponize systems against you."

Get your own legal advice immediately. Document everything. Don't engage without counsel.

**What they mean:**
"I'll isolate you from our shared world."

**The function:**
Destroys your support network. Makes leaving more costly.

**Your response:**

---

**CARD 36: THE RESET**

**What they say:**
"We need to put the past behind us."
"Why are you bringing up old stuff?"
"Let's start fresh."
"Holding grudges is unhealthy."

**What they mean:**
"If we don't discuss what happened, I don't have to be accountable for it."

**The function:**
Erases history. Prevents learning. Enables repeat.

**Your response:**
"I'm not holding a grudge—I'm recognizing a pattern."
Past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior.

---

**CARD 37: THE TRUTH CRUMB**

**What they say:**
"Okay, maybe I did do that one thing."
Partial admission mixed with minimization.
Acknowledging 10% to deny 90%.
