# Chapter 4: The Rage That Rises

## The Feeling No One Talks About

---

You weren't supposed to feel this way toward your child.

Frustration, yes. Exhaustion, certainly. Even impatience—everyone says that's normal.

But rage? This thing that rises up from somewhere deep, that fills your chest and tightens your throat and makes your hands want to do something you would never, ever forgive yourself for?

This isn't in the parenting books. This isn't what mothers admit to in playgroups. This isn't what fathers discuss over beers.

And so you hold it alone. This secret shame. This monstrous feeling that appears in response to something as ordinary as a child who won't put on shoes, a toddler who bit you again, a teenager who rolled their eyes.

The rage rises. And you don't know what to do with it.

Let's talk about it.

## Field Note: The Morning on the Floor

She was kneeling on the bathroom floor, hands over her mouth, trying not to scream.

Her two-year-old was in the hallway, crying. She had just put him there—not roughly, but not gently either—because she could feel it coming and she knew, with terrifying certainty, that if she stayed in that room one more second, she would do something she could never take back.

This was the third morning in a row he had refused to get dressed. The third morning of screaming, thrashing, going boneless. And something in her had snapped.

Not at him. She hadn't hurt him. But inside her body, a rage had risen that felt capable of anything.

*What is wrong with me?*

She stayed on the floor until her breathing slowed. Then she washed her face, opened the door, and saw him there, still crying, reaching for her.

She picked him up. Held him. Rocked until they were both calm.

And later, after nap time, she called a therapist. Because she knew: whatever that rage was, it wasn't really about him. And she needed to find out what it was about before it found a way out.

## The Shame of Parental Rage

Before we go any further, let's address the shame.

Parental rage is one of the most shameful experiences a parent can have. It strikes at the core of our identity as protectors, as caregivers, as the people who are supposed to love our children unconditionally.

When rage rises toward our own child—this small, dependent person who trusts us—the cognitive dissonance is unbearable. We are not supposed to want to hurt them. We are not supposed to feel violent impulses. We are not supposed to be capable of this.

And so we hide it. We perform calm while volcanic pressure builds inside. We smile through gritted teeth. We pretend we have it together when we are held together by threads.

The shame does two things:

**It isolates us.** Because we can't talk about this, we can't get help. We assume we're uniquely monstrous, when in fact parental rage is common enough to have its own clinical literature.

**It increases the pressure.** Shame doesn't release rage—it contains it. Like a pressure cooker with no valve, the rage builds until it explodes. The shame we feel about our rage makes the rage more likely to erupt.

**Permission:** You are not a monster for feeling rage. You are a human with a nervous system that is overwhelmed. The rage is a signal, not a sentence. And you can learn to work with it.

## Why Rage Rises

Let's understand the mechanism.

**Rage is a survival response.**

Specifically, it's the "fight" branch of the fight-flight-freeze response. When your nervous system perceives threat and determines that flight is not possible, it mobilizes for fight.

In parenting, flight often isn't possible. You can't abandon your child. You can't leave the situation. You're trapped in the demand.

So the body, seeking an outlet for survival energy, turns to fight. Rage.

**Rage is also a secondary emotion.**

This means it often covers something else. Under rage, there is usually:

- Fear (of losing control, of being inadequate, of repeating your parents' patterns)
- Hurt (of not being appreciated, of giving endlessly without receiving)
- Grief (for the childhood you didn't have, for the parent you wish you could be)
- Overwhelm (too many demands, too little capacity)
- Powerlessness (nothing you do works, you're at the mercy of a tiny tyrant)

The rage is the top layer. Beneath it is the vulnerability.

**Rage is often historical.**

The intensity of parental rage—that quality of being bigger than the situation warrants—usually means it's connected to the past.

Your child refusing to get dressed is annoying. The rage that makes you feel like screaming, breaking things, or worse—that intensity is not about the present situation. It's old rage, finding a current outlet.

If you experienced rage as a child—if you were raged at—then your nervous system is primed for this response. You learned that rage is what happens when control is lost. You may have even learned that rage is what power looks like.

If you were not allowed to feel rage as a child—if your anger was punished, shamed, or ignored—then you have decades of unexpressed anger stored in your body. Your child's provocations tap into that reservoir.

Either way, the rage is historical before it's present.

## Neuroscience Lens: The Rage Circuit

When rage activates, here's what happens in your brain and body:

**1. The amygdala detects threat.**

The threat might be real (your child is running toward the street) or symbolic (your authority is being challenged, your needs are being ignored). The amygdala doesn't distinguish—it just sounds the alarm.

**2. The hypothalamus activates the stress response.**

Adrenaline and cortisol flood your system. Your heart rate increases. Blood flows to your muscles. Your body is preparing for combat.

**3. The prefrontal cortex goes partially offline.**

This is critical. The part of your brain responsible for:
- Perspective-taking
- Impulse control
- Understanding consequences
- Empathy
- Rational thought

...is receiving less blood flow. You're literally losing access to your higher functions.

**4. The limbic system takes over.**

You're now running on the emotional brain—the part designed for survival, not parenting. This part of the brain doesn't care about your child's developmental stage, your parenting philosophy, or what the books say. It cares about eliminating the threat.

**5. Motor preparation activates.**

Your muscles tense. Your hands want to do something. Your voice wants to get loud. The body is ready to fight, and it's looking for permission.

This entire cascade takes less than a second. By the time you realize you're in rage, the cascade is already well underway.

**This is why you can't think your way out of rage.** The thinking brain is offline. Any intervention has to work with the body, not just the mind.

## The Rage You Inherited

For most parents who struggle with rage, the pattern is inherited.

**If you were raged at:**

Your nervous system learned early that when things get overwhelming, rage is what happens. You absorbed your parent's dysregulation. You learned that rage is power, rage gets results, rage is what adults do.

Now, when you're overwhelmed, your nervous system reaches for the same tool. Not because you're choosing it—because it was installed.

**If you were not allowed to be angry:**

Your anger was shamed, punished, or ignored. You learned to suppress it. You became "nice," "calm," "easygoing"—because expressing anger meant losing love.

But the anger didn't go anywhere. It stayed in your body, accumulating. Decades of unfelt rage, waiting for a pressure valve.

Your child becomes that valve. Their behavior, which would be mildly frustrating to someone without your history, connects to the entire reservoir of unexpressed anger. And suddenly a three-year-old's tantrum releases thirty years of stored rage.

**If you witnessed rage between others:**

You may have learned that rage is what happens in relationships. That intensity is normal. That escalation is just how conflict works.

Or you may have learned to fear rage so much that your own anger terrifies you. The shame you feel about your rage is itself a legacy of witnessing rage's damage.

## Field Note: The Inheritance

His father hit.

Not often. Not with warning. But when the rage came, it came fast—a backhand, a shove, once a belt that left welts for days.

He swore he would never.

And he hadn't. Thirty-five years old, two children, and he had never hit. That was the line, and he had held it.

But something else happened instead. When the rage rose—and it rose, it always rose—he felt his body move. Not to hit. But to loom. To get close. To use his size, his voice, his presence as weapon.

His children flinched at his footsteps. They watched his face the way he used to watch his father's face. They were learning to be small.

He hadn't hit. But he had taught them what he taught himself to fear: that anger makes fathers dangerous.

The inheritance wasn't in the action. It was in the energy.

## What Your Rage Is Telling You

Rage is information. When it rises, it's telling you something. Common messages include:

**"I'm overwhelmed and I need support."**

Rage often shows up when you're running on empty—sleep-deprived, over-extended, without help. The rage is a desperate signal that your resources are depleted.

**"I feel powerless and I need control."**

When you can't get your child to cooperate, when nothing you do works, the powerlessness can become intolerable. Rage is an attempt to reclaim power—through force if necessary.

**"I'm touched out and I need space."**

For primary caregivers, especially of young children, being needed constantly can become unbearable. The rage says: I have nothing left to give and they're still taking.

**"This situation is activating old wounds."**

The disproportionate intensity is a flag. Something from your past is being activated. The rage is historical, using the present as an outlet.

**"I feel unseen, unappreciated, alone."**

Parenting can be profoundly isolating. When no one witnesses your sacrifice, when your efforts go unacknowledged, when you feel invisible—rage can be the signal of that loneliness.

**"Something in my life needs to change."**

Sometimes parental rage is the only emotion loud enough to break through denial. It's telling you: something is unsustainable here. The relationship, the division of labor, the lack of support—something needs to change.

Rage is never just about the moment. It's always carrying additional information. Learning to decode that information is part of the healing.

## What Rage Wants

When rage rises, it wants something. Understanding what it wants can help you work with it instead of against it.

**Rage wants discharge.**

The survival energy mobilized for fight needs to go somewhere. If it can't go outward (and it shouldn't go toward your child), it will stay stuck in your body, building pressure.

Healthy discharge looks like:
- Physical movement (stomping, pushing against a wall, running)
- Sound (screaming into a pillow, growling, using a loud exhale)
- Tears (rage and grief are often connected)
- Shaking (the body's natural way of releasing survival energy)

**Rage wants power.**

Underlying rage is often powerlessness. What would help you feel more powerful in your life, in your parenting? What support, what changes, what resources would reduce the sense of being trapped?

**Rage wants acknowledgment.**

The anger often contains truth that needs to be heard. Not acted upon violently, but acknowledged. "I am exhausted. I am overwhelmed. I am not getting my needs met. This is hard."

Sometimes just naming the truth can reduce the pressure.

**Rage wants protection of something tender.**

Often, rage is guarding something vulnerable—the part of you that is hurt, scared, grieving, or in need. When that tender part can be accessed directly, the rage may not be needed.

## First Interventions: When Rage Is Rising

The most important moment is when you feel rage rising—before it peaks. This is when intervention is possible. Here are concrete practices:

**1. Create physical distance immediately.**

Don't try to parent through the rage. Say: "I need a minute" or "I'm going to take a break." Then leave the room.

If your child is in danger (too young to be left alone, near hazards), move them to a safe location first. But create distance as quickly as safely possible.

**2. Discharge the energy physically.**

Once you're alone:
- Push against a wall as hard as you can
- Stomp your feet
- Squeeze a pillow
- Run cold water over your wrists
- Splash cold water on your face
- Do aggressive exhales (push the breath out with force)

The body needs to move the survival energy. Let it move without hurting yourself or anything.

**3. Drop below the rage.**

Ask yourself: What's underneath this? What am I really feeling?

Often, accessing the grief or fear under the rage releases it. Tears are a discharge valve. If you can cry, let yourself.

**4. Ground yourself.**

- Feel your feet on the floor
- Name five things you can see
- Touch something with texture and notice how it feels
- Take slow breaths, making the exhale longer than the inhale

Grounding brings you back to the present, out of the survival response.

**5. Use a mantra.**

Have a phrase ready that you can repeat:
- "This is not an emergency."
- "They are a child. I am the adult."
- "I can feel this without acting on it."
- "This will pass. I will not break."

The repetition interrupts the escalation and gives the thinking brain something to do.

## A Practice: The Rage Protocol

Use this when you feel rage rising:

**STEP 1: RECOGNIZE** (1 second)
Name it internally: "This is rage."

**STEP 2: REMOVE** (10 seconds)
Get away from your child. Any exit line: "I need a minute." "I'm going to take a break." Just go.

**STEP 3: RELEASE** (30-60 seconds)
Discharge physically. Push against a wall. Stomp. Shake your hands. Make sound if possible—growl, exhale forcefully, grunt.

**STEP 4: REGULATE** (1-3 minutes)
Slow your breathing. 4 counts in, 6 counts out. Feel your feet. Splash cold water on your face. Ground.

**STEP 5: REFLECT** (optional, later)
When you're calm: What was the rage about? What triggered it? What unmet need is it signaling?

**STEP 6: REPAIR** (when ready)
Return to your child. Acknowledge what happened: "I got really frustrated and I needed to calm down. I'm feeling better now."

The entire protocol, from recognition to repair, might take 5-10 minutes. That's much better than hours of aftermath from a rage explosion.

---

## Emergency Interventions

For moments when rage feels uncontrollable—when you're not sure you can keep from harming your child:

**Put them somewhere safe and walk away.**

Crib, playpen, gated room, anywhere they can't hurt themselves. Then go. Any amount of crying is better than any amount of harm.

**Call someone.**

Partner, friend, family member, crisis line. Anyone who can either come help or talk you down.

**Go outside.**

Step outside the house if you can do so safely. The change of environment can interrupt the escalation.

**Ice water or cold shower.**

Extreme temperature change activates the dive reflex and shifts the nervous system quickly. Hold ice cubes, splash cold water, or even step into a cold shower.

**Make yourself small.**

Sit on the floor. Curl into a ball. Get into a closet or small space. Making your body small can downshift the fight response.

**Wait for the wave to pass.**

Rage, like all emotions, moves in waves. It peaks and then subsides. If you can hold on—without acting—it will pass. You just have to not act during the peak.

---

## The Never Line

Let's be clear about the line that must not be crossed:

**Never hit, shake, throw, or physically harm your child.**

Never.

If you feel you are in danger of crossing this line, treat it as a crisis. Call for help. Remove yourself completely. Seek immediate support.

Physical violence against children is always harmful. It damages their developing brains, their sense of safety, their attachment to you, their future relationships.

If you have crossed this line, you need professional help. Not shame. Help. A trauma-informed therapist who specializes in parenting can work with you to ensure it doesn't happen again.

The rage is not your fault. The childhood that installed it was not your fault. But the action is your responsibility. Get support before you harm what you love.

---

## Verbal Violence: The Other Line

Physical harm is the obvious line. But there is another kind of harm that rage can cause:

- Screaming in their face
- Name-calling, insults, shaming
- Cruel words said to wound
- Threatening harm or abandonment
- Making them responsible for your emotions

Verbal violence leaves marks that aren't visible. It's still harm. It still damages their developing brains and sense of safety.

The same interventions apply: recognize, remove, regulate. If you feel verbally violent words rising, leave before you speak them.

And if they've already come out—repair. Acknowledge what you said. Take responsibility. Make clear that your words were wrong, not them.

---

## The Shame After

After rage—especially if you've said or done things you regret—the shame arrives.

The shame tells you: *You're just like your parents. You've done irreversible damage. You're not fit to be a parent.*

This shame is not helpful. It doesn't make you a better parent—it makes you a more anxious, more defensive, more likely to rage again parent.

What to do with the shame:

**1. Don't argue with it or try to fix it.**

Let the shame be present without believing it. Notice it as a sensation in your body, not as truth.

**2. Separate action from identity.**

"I did something harmful" is different from "I am a harmful person." The first is accountability. The second is shame spiraling.

**3. Repair with your child.**

The shame often wants to avoid your child—to pretend it didn't happen. But repair is what actually helps both of you. Go to them. Acknowledge. Reconnect.

**4. Learn from it without weaponizing it.**

Ask: What was I needing? What triggered me? What can I do differently? Use the incident as information, not as evidence of irredeemable badness.

**5. Practice self-compassion.**

You are a human with a nervous system shaped by trauma, trying to parent under stress, with limited resources and support. Your rage is understandable. That doesn't make it okay, but it makes it workable.

## Field Note: The Repair

She had yelled.

Really yelled—that voice that felt like her mother's voice, the one she swore she'd never use. And she saw it land on her daughter's face. Saw the fear, the hurt, the sudden distance.

The shame came immediately. She wanted to disappear. She wanted to pretend it hadn't happened.

Instead, she waited until the rage had fully passed—maybe twenty minutes. Then she went to her daughter's room.

"Hey. Can I sit with you?"

Her daughter nodded, wary.

"I yelled at you before. Really loudly. And that was scary."

A small nod.

"I was very frustrated, but my yelling wasn't okay. It wasn't your fault. I'm sorry."

Her daughter looked at her. "Why did you yell so loud?"

She thought carefully. "Sometimes grown-ups have big feelings too. And I haven't learned how to manage mine very well yet. But I'm working on it. And no matter how frustrated I get, you don't deserve to be yelled at like that."

Her daughter considered this. "Sometimes I have big feelings too."

"I know you do. And I'm going to try really hard to help you with yours, and also to work on mine. Is there anything that would help you feel better right now?"

"Can we read a story?"

"Yeah. We can read a story."

It wasn't perfect. It didn't undo the yell. But something had been repaired. Something about: I see you, I hurt you, I'm responsible, and we're still connected.

## The Long-Term Work

Managing parental rage is not a one-time fix. It's an ongoing practice that has layers:

**Layer 1: Acute Management**

The practices in this chapter—the rage protocol, the emergency interventions, the discharge techniques. These are for the immediate moments of activation.

**Layer 2: Nervous System Regulation**

Daily practices that widen your window of tolerance and keep your baseline regulation higher:
- Regular physical exercise
- Adequate sleep (as much as possible with children)
- Mindfulness practice
- Breathing exercises
- Time in nature
- Physical touch and connection

When your baseline is more regulated, you're less likely to tip into rage.

**Layer 3: Trigger Investigation**

Understanding what specifically triggers your rage. Keeping a journal. Noticing patterns. Working with a therapist to trace triggers back to their origins.

When you understand the pattern, you have more agency within it.

**Layer 4: Processing the Original Wound**

This is the deep work. Going back to the childhood experiences where the rage pattern was installed. Grieving. Feeling the anger that couldn't be expressed then. Completing the survival responses that got stuck.

This work typically requires professional support—a trauma-informed therapist, EMDR, somatic experiencing, or other modalities.

**Layer 5: Changing Life Circumstances**

Sometimes the rage is telling you that something structural needs to change:
- More support (help with childcare, partnership equity, community)
- Less stress (career changes, financial stability, simplifying life)
- Better relationship (with partner, with family of origin)
- Unmet needs being met (rest, creativity, autonomy, connection)

Sometimes the rage won't resolve until the circumstances do.

## What Your Children Need to Know About Anger

As you do this work, you're also teaching your children something about anger. Here's what they need to learn:

**Anger is a valid emotion.**

Everyone feels anger. It's not bad or shameful. It's information about boundaries, fairness, and needs.

**Anger is different from aggression.**

Feeling angry is always okay. Acting aggressively is not. You can feel like yelling without yelling. You can feel like hitting without hitting.

**Anger can be expressed safely.**

There are ways to let anger out that don't hurt anyone: stomping, pillow-punching, growling, running, drawing angry pictures, talking about it.

**Adults are responsible for managing their own anger.**

When a parent gets angry, it's not the child's fault. The child didn't cause it. The parent is responsible for handling their own feelings.

**Repair is always possible.**

When anger leads to something harmful, repair can happen. Apologies, reconnection, making it right. Anger doesn't have to end relationships.

You teach these things not primarily through words, but through modeling. When you manage your anger well, when you repair after managing it poorly, when you acknowledge anger without being ruled by it—you're teaching.

---

## A Note for Those Who Don't Feel Rage

Some parents reading this are thinking: I don't have this problem. I never feel rage.

Two possibilities:

**1. You genuinely have a well-regulated nervous system.**

Maybe your childhood was relatively safe. Maybe you've done significant healing work. Maybe you're naturally calm. If so, congratulations—skip this chapter.

**2. You're cut off from your anger.**

If your anger was punished, shamed, or terrifying as a child, you may have learned to disconnect from it entirely. You may feel numbness, detachment, or depression where others feel rage.

The danger here is that the anger is still present—just not accessible. It may leak out as passive-aggression, criticism, withdrawal, or resentment. Or it may implode as depression, physical illness, or self-harm.

If you never feel anger in situations where anger would be normal—if your child can do anything and you just feel... nothing—that's worth exploring with a therapist. The anger may need to be accessed before it can be processed.

## Integration

> *"Rage is a signal, not a sentence. It's telling you that something is overwhelming your capacity—and that something needs to change."*

Take a breath.

What arose for you reading this chapter?

Perhaps shame. Perhaps recognition. Perhaps relief that someone is finally naming this.

Whatever it is, let it be here.

The rage is not who you are. It's an artifact of what happened to you. And you are working to transform it—for yourself, for your child, for the lineage.

Every time you feel rage and don't act on it, you're breaking the chain.

Every time you repair after acting on it, you're teaching something new.

Every time you ask for help instead of hiding in shame, you're creating possibility.

The rage was inherited. The healing is yours.

And you are choosing healing.

---

*"You cannot keep yourself from feeling rage. But you can learn to feel it without becoming it. That distinction is everything."*
