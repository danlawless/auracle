## Welcome Email Body

---

**Welcome to the journey.**

I'm Jennifer, and I'm genuinely glad you're here.

If you found me, you probably know what it's like to leave a conversation feeling worse about yourself—without being able to explain why. To doubt your own perception. To wonder if you're "too sensitive" or if something really is wrong.

Let me settle that right now:

**You're not too sensitive. You're finally seeing clearly.**

---

### What You'll Get Here

Every week, I send one email. Just one. No overwhelm.

Each one contains:

- **A pattern named** — Something you've felt but couldn't articulate
- **A reframe** — A new way to understand what happened
- **A practice** — Something you can actually do

My goal isn't to give you more to think about. It's to help you feel more grounded in your own experience.

### Your First Tool: The 3-3-3 Rule

When you're activated and need to respond, use this:

**3 Seconds:** Pause. Count silently. Interrupt the automatic reaction.

**3 Breaths:** Inhale 4, exhale 6. Engage your calm nervous system.

**3 Words (or fewer):** "I'll think about that." "Interesting perspective." "Not for me."

The less you say, the less they have to twist.

This is the foundation. More tools are coming.

Thank you for trusting me with your inbox. I don't take that lightly.

See you soon,

**Jennifer**

P.S. — If this email resonated, reply and tell me one thing. What pattern are you most trying to understand right now? I read every response.

## Alternative: Shorter Version

If you want something more concise:

---

**Subject:** You're in. Here's your first tool.

Welcome to the newsletter.

Here's what I believe: You're not too sensitive. The patterns you're seeing are real. And naming them is the first step to breaking free.

**Your first tool—The 3-3-3 Rule:**

When activated, pause 3 seconds, take 3 breaths, respond in 3 words or fewer.

*"I'll think about that." "Interesting perspective." "Not for me."*

The less you say, the less they have to twist.

More coming soon.

— Jennifer
