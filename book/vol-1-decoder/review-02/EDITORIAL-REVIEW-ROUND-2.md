### 2. Index Chapter Reference Errors

The index (appendix-e-index.md) contains multiple incorrect chapter references:

| Index Entry | Current Reference | Correct Reference |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Decoder Cards - Advanced patterns | Chapter 12 | Chapter 15 |
| Decoder Cards - Core patterns | Chapter 11 | Chapter 14 |
| Energetic Remapping | Chapter 14 | Chapter 17 |

## HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

- Line 45: `Chapter 1: The Opening Manifesto — What This Book Is Really About`
- Line 47: `Chapter 2: The Energetic Signature — How to Recognize Control...`
- Lines 49-103: All chapter and appendix TOC entries

All "Who This Book Is For" list items (Lines 123-128):
- `- **The confused** — Anyone who has left...` (should be `**The confused**—Anyone...`)

**Chapter 14 Title:**
- Line 1: `# Chapter 11: Decoder Cards — Core Patterns` → `# Chapter 11: Decoder Cards—Core Patterns`

**Chapter 17 Title:**
- Line 1: `# Chapter 17: Energetic Remapping — Recovery Tools` → `# Chapter 17: Energetic Remapping—Recovery Tools`

**Appendix C (appendix-c-bibliography.md):** Lines 247-251

- All cross-reference entries (See Chapter X) use spaced em dashes

### 4. Gendered Language Inconsistencies

| Line | Original | Correction |
|------|----------|------------|
| 45 | `"He'll break your meditation to prove your focus belongs to him."` | `"They'll break your meditation to prove your focus belongs to them."` |
| 71 | `"He doesn't shout because he's angry—he shouts to rewrite the room's frequency."` | `"They don't shout because they're angry—they shout to rewrite the room's frequency."` |
| 99 | `"His environment reflects the chaos he refuses to clean inside."` | `"Their environment reflects the chaos they refuse to clean inside."` |

2. Correct all 10 chapter reference errors in the index
3. Remove spaces from all em dashes in front matter TOC (31 instances)

### High Priority
4. Standardize em dash spacing throughout manuscript (51+ instances)
5. Update gendered pronouns in Chapter 3A to match gender-neutral style

### Medium Priority
6. Correct capitalization of role names (Golden Child, Scapegoat, etc.)
7. Update hyphen to en dash for ranges

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

The manuscript demonstrates strong editorial consistency following Round 1. The issues identified in Round 2 are primarily:

1. **Systematic formatting patterns** (em dash spacing) that can be corrected with find/replace
2. **Cross-reference accuracy** that requires verification against final chapter structure
3. **Minor style guide refinements** for capitalization and number formatting

**Publication Readiness:** Near-ready pending correction of critical chapter numbering and index errors.
