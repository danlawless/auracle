## Key Terms for Parenting After Trauma

---

## A

**Activation**
A nervous system state triggered by perceived threat. In parenting, often triggered by a child's behavior that mirrors your own childhood pain.

**Attunement**
The capacity to sense and respond appropriately to a child's emotional needs. Not mind-reading, but presence and responsiveness.

---

## C

**Co-regulation**
The process by which a parent's regulated nervous system helps a child regulate. Children borrow regulation from caregivers before developing their own capacity.

---

## D

**Differentiation**
Recognizing that your child is a separate person with their own experience, not an extension of you or a repetition of your past.

---

## F

**Forced Allegiance**
Being recruited into loyalty tests, asked to take sides against a parent, or exposed to ridicule between caregivers. Creates protective dissociation and blank spots in memory.

---

## G

**Golden Repair**
The Japanese art of kintsugi applied to parenting—the understanding that repaired ruptures create stronger bonds than if rupture never occurred.

---

## I

**Intergenerational Transmission**
The passing of patterns, wounds, and adaptations from one generation to the next through modeling, environment, and relational dynamics.

---

## L

**Lineage Work**
The conscious effort to end harmful patterns passed down through generations while preserving what serves.

---

## M

**Mediator / Truth Holder Role**
A family role where one child becomes the go-between for parents who won't speak directly. Creates adults who are sensitive to triangulation and over-function in relational maintenance.

---

## P

**Parentified Child**
A child who took on parental responsibilities—emotional caretaking, household management, or sibling care—before developmentally ready.

**Projection**
Unconsciously attributing your own unprocessed feelings or experiences to your child.

---

## R

**Repair**
The process of restoring connection after rupture. More important than preventing rupture. Teaches children that relationships can survive disconnection.

**Ridicule as Bonding**
A family pattern where mockery of outsiders creates belonging. Teaches that contempt is acceptable, dehumanization is bonding, and belonging requires participation in ridicule.

**Rupture**
A break in attunement or connection between parent and child. Natural and inevitable. What matters is what follows.

---

## S

**Secure Attachment**
A relational pattern where a child feels safe to explore, knows they can return for comfort, and trusts the caregiver's availability.

---

## T

**Trauma Response**
Fight, flight, freeze, or fawn reactions activated by perceived threat. In parenting, can be triggered by a child's behavior that activates old wounds.

**Triangulation**
Using a third party to communicate rather than speaking directly. In parenting, using children as message-passers between adults. Harmful to all parties.

---

## W

**Window of Tolerance**
The range of emotional arousal within which a person (parent or child) can function effectively. Outside this window, dysregulation occurs.
