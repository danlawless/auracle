## Week 1: Recognition Theme

**Focus:** Introducing the core concepts of control disguised as care

---

### Day 1 (Launch Day)

**Platform:** Social + Substack Welcome Email

**Hook:** "You didn't do anything wrong."

**Content:**
> The confusion you felt? That was the point. The self-doubt? Engineered. The feeling that you were somehow both too much and never enough? That was the trap, and it was set long before you walked into it.

**CTA:** Link to book / newsletter signup

---

### Day 2

**Platform:** Social (Quote Card)

**Hook:** The Invisible Architecture

**Content:**
> Control rarely announces itself. It doesn't walk into the room with a sign that says "I will diminish you." Instead, it arrives dressed as concern, love, honesty, protection, or logic.

**CTA:** "More in my new book" + link

---

### Day 3

**Platform:** Social (Carousel or Thread)

**Hook:** 5 Disguises of Control

**Content:**
1. **Concern:** "I was just checking on you."
2. **Love:** "I only act this way because I care so much."
3. **Honesty:** "I'm just telling you the truth—no one else will."
4. **Protection:** "I'm trying to keep you safe."
5. **Logic:** "You're being emotional. Let's be rational here."

**CTA:** "Which one sounds familiar? Comment below."

---

### Day 4

**Platform:** Social (Single powerful quote)

**Hook:** The Only Test You Need

**Content:**
> Genuine care makes you feel more yourself. Control disguised as care makes you feel less yourself. That's the only test you need.

**CTA:** Save this. Screenshot it. Share it.

---

### Day 5

**Platform:** Social (Educational)

**Hook:** The 72-Hour Test

**Content:**
Before making any major decision about someone, wait 72 hours.

Why?
- Love-bombing neurochemistry needs time to settle
- Patterns invisible in excitement become visible in calm
- Trust the version of yourself that emerges after the intensity fades

**CTA:** "This test alone would have saved most of us years."

---

### Day 6

**Platform:** Social (Quote Card)

**Hook:** The Power of Naming

**Content:**
> When you can name what's happening, it stops happening TO you and starts happening IN FRONT OF you.

**CTA:** Free Decoder Cards in bio

---

### Day 7

**Platform:** Substack Newsletter #1

**Subject:** "The confusion was the point"

**Content:**
- Introduce yourself and why you wrote the book
- Share the "control disguised as care" framework
- Include the 72-Hour Test as a practical takeaway
- CTA: Get the free Decoder Cards

---

## Week 2: Tactics Theme

**Focus:** Naming specific manipulation patterns (from The Playbook)

---

### Day 8

**Platform:** Social (Tactic Deep Dive)

**Hook:** Tactic: Concern as Control

**Content:**
"Just checking on you" sounds caring. But sometimes it's surveillance disguised as concern.

The difference? Caring people trust your ability to manage yourself. Controlling people need to monitor you.

**Power Move:** "I'm fine—I'll reach out if I need anything."

**CTA:** 37 more tactics in The Narcissism Decoder

---

### Day 9

**Platform:** Social (Quote Card)

**Hook:** The Gaslight Loop

**Content:**
Repeated "Huh?" and "What do you mean?" responses aren't confusion.

They're a tactic.

**Your response:** "I was clear. Let me know when you're ready to engage with what I said."

---

### Day 10

**Platform:** Social (Carousel)

**Hook:** 3 Ways Shame Gets Dumped On You

**Content:**
1. "I feel bad for you"
2. "You're too sensitive"
3. "That's a you problem"

What's happening: Their shame is intolerable, so they deposit it in you.

**Power Move:** "I return this shame to its source."

---

### Day 11

**Platform:** Social (Quote Card)

**Hook:** Moving Goalposts

**Content:**
> Nothing you do will ever be enough—because your inadequacy is the point.

If you ever fully succeeded, they'd lose leverage.

Ask: "What would 'good enough' actually look like? Is it possible?"

---

### Day 12

**Platform:** Social (Tactic Deep Dive)

**Hook:** Righteous Cruelty

**Content:**
"I'm just being honest."
"Someone needs to tell you the truth."
"I'm only saying this because I care."

This is cruelty dressed as virtue.

Real feedback is given with care, at appropriate times, for YOUR benefit. If it feels like an attack, it is.

---

### Day 13

**Platform:** Social (Quote Card)

**Hook:** The Comparison Trap

**Content:**
"My ex never had this problem."
"Most women would be grateful."

Your response: "I'm not in competition for this relationship. If you'd prefer to be with someone else, that's a choice you can make."

---

### Day 14

**Platform:** Substack Newsletter #2

**Subject:** "The 6 tactics you need to name this week"

**Content:**
- Brief intro
- Cover 6 tactics with pattern/power move format
- End with: "Naming breaks the spell"

---

## Week 3: Why We Get Hooked Theme

**Focus:** Understanding trauma bonds and attachment (bridging Vol 1 & 2)

---

### Day 15

**Platform:** Social (Quote Card)

**Hook:** Chemistry vs. Familiarity

**Content:**
> What we call "chemistry" is often familiarity. What we call "boring" is often safety we haven't learned to trust yet.

---

### Day 16

**Platform:** Social (Educational)

**Hook:** Why Fast Burns Hook Trauma Survivors

**Content:**
For those who grew up in dysregulated environments:
- Intensity = love (that's what you knew)
- Anxiety = passion (that's how love felt)
- Quick bonding = safety (the faster you lock in, the safer you are)

Your nervous system seeks what it knows, not what it needs.

---

### Day 17

**Platform:** Social (Carousel)

**Hook:** Fast Burn vs. Slow Burn

**Slide 1:** Fast Burn feels like: Destiny. Chemistry. Soul-level connection early.

**Slide 2:** What's actually happening: Dopamine spike + Cortisol spike + Familiar activation pattern

**Slide 3:** Slow Burn feels like: Nice but not electric. Steady but not thrilling.

**Slide 4:** What's actually happening: Your nervous system is regulating. Safety is being established.

**Slide 5:** "Slow burn feels boring only until safety becomes attractive."

---

### Day 18

**Platform:** Social (Quote Card)

**Hook:** The Core Reframe

**Content:**
> Intensity isn't intimacy. Intensity is intensity.

Safety is what allows real intimacy to grow.

---

### Day 19

**Platform:** Social (Educational)

**Hook:** The Guilt Ledger

**Content:**
"After everything I've done for you..."
"You owe me."

Previous kindness is being converted into debt. Every nice thing becomes leverage.

**Truth:** Kindness given freely isn't a loan. Real generosity doesn't come with a ledger.

---

### Day 20

**Platform:** Social (Quote Card)

**Hook:** Pity as Control

**Content:**
"I always ruin the good things."
"I'm broken."
"I sabotage myself."

This isn't a confession—it's a deflection. You shift from confronting to caretaking.

**Hold the line:** "That's something you'll need to work on, but it doesn't excuse what happened."

---

### Day 21

**Platform:** Substack Newsletter #3

**Subject:** "Why insight alone doesn't heal"

**Content:**
- The gap between knowing and changing
- Fast burn vs slow burn explanation
- Why your nervous system seeks familiarity
- Teaser for Volume 2: The Bridge
- CTA: Pre-order/waitlist for Vol 2

---

## Week 4: Your Power Moves Theme

**Focus:** Practical tools and responses

---

### Day 22

**Platform:** Social (Shareable Graphic)

**Hook:** The 3-3-3 Rule

**Content:**
When you recognize manipulation, use this:

**3 Seconds:** Pause. Count silently. Interrupt the automatic reaction.

**3 Breaths:** Inhale 4, exhale 6. Engage your calm nervous system.

**3 Words:** "I'll think about that." "Interesting perspective." "Not for me."

The less you say, the less they have to twist.

---

### Day 23

**Platform:** Social (Educational)

**Hook:** Decoder Card: Withholding as Punishment

**Content:**
- One-word answers
- The silent treatment
- "I'm fine" (clearly not fine)

Normal warmth is withdrawn as punishment. You're supposed to feel the cold and abandon your position.

**Power Move:** Don't chase. "I'm here when you're ready to talk directly."

---

### Day 24

**Platform:** Social (Quote Card)

**Hook:** When They Apologize With Self-Pity

**Content:**
> Do NOT comfort them. Their "pain" is a shield, not a wound.

Stay on behavior, not their inner world. "Regardless of why, the action was wrong."

---

### Day 25

**Platform:** Social (Carousel)

**Hook:** 5 Power Moves for Any Manipulation

**Content:**
1. **Pause:** "I need to think about that."
2. **Mirror:** "Help me understand what you mean."
3. **Boundary:** "That's not for me."
4. **Exit:** "I need to step away for a moment."
5. **Document:** Write it down later.

---

### Day 26

**Platform:** Social (Quote Card)

**Hook:** The Exit Line

**Content:**
Have one memorized:

"I need to step away for a moment."

No explanation. No negotiation. Use it whenever you feel your body contracting.

---

### Day 27

**Platform:** Social (Educational)

**Hook:** Reality Revision Response

**Content:**
"I never said that."
"You're misremembering."
"You're making things up."

Your response: Trust your perception. "I know what I experienced."

You don't need their agreement for your experience to be valid.

---

### Day 28

**Platform:** Substack Newsletter #4

**Subject:** "Your power moves toolkit"

**Content:**
- The 3-3-3 Rule
- 5 phrases to memorize
- The documentation habit
- Why less is more in responses

**Focus:** Transition to healing content (building anticipation for Vol 2)

---

### Day 29

**Platform:** Social (Quote Card)

**Hook:** The Bridge

**Content:**
> Secure attachment is not found—it is practiced.

Your nervous system learned safety through vigilance and anticipation. Healing requires new experiences, not more understanding.

Coming soon: The Bridge

---
