### What to Look For

When seeking support for embodied work:
- Trauma-informed approach
- Understanding of the nervous system
- Respect for your pace and boundaries
- No pressure to share before you're ready
- Their own grounded, regulated presence
- Experience with sexual healing (if relevant)
- Clear professional boundaries

### Red Flags

- Pushing you faster than your system is ready
- Using techniques without explaining them
- Touching without clear consent
- Blurring professional and personal boundaries
- Claiming one approach works for everyone
- Dismissing your experience or intuition

## A Note on Resources

The goal isn't to find the perfect teacher, book, or practice.

The goal is to return to your body, trust your own signals, and lead from presence rather than performance.

Resources support the journey. They don't replace the work only you can do.

Take what serves. Leave what doesn't. Trust yourself to know the difference.
