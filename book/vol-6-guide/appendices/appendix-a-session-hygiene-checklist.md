# Appendix A: Session Hygiene Checklist

## Protecting Your Field While Holding Others' Healing

---

You cannot pour from an empty cup. You cannot regulate someone else from your own dysregulation. You cannot hold space if you've abandoned yourself.

Session hygiene is not about being cold or clinical. It's about sustainability. It's about showing up fully—session after session, year after year—without burning out, absorbing, or losing yourself.

This appendix gives you the practical tools to maintain your own field while holding space for others.

## Why Session Hygiene Matters

### The Neuroscience

When you sit with someone in pain:
- Your mirror neurons fire as if you're experiencing their pain
- Your nervous system attunes to theirs
- Their emotional state literally affects your biology
- Your body absorbs what you witness

**Without hygiene practices:**
- Their material stays in your system
- Your nervous system accumulates activation
- You carry home what belongs in the session
- Compassion fatigue builds silently

**With hygiene practices:**
- You witness without absorbing
- Your nervous system returns to baseline
- You leave the session in the session
- You can sustain this work for decades

### The Relational Reality

Session hygiene also protects the relationship:
- Clear boundaries create safety
- Your groundedness becomes their resource
- Your regulation is contagious
- Your sustainability ensures availability

*You are the instrument. Instruments require maintenance.*

## Part I: Pre-Session Hygiene

### Before Any Session Day

**1. The Night Before**

- Set intention for tomorrow's sessions
- Review tomorrow's clients briefly (who needs what?)
- Clear anything unfinished from today
- Get adequate sleep (non-negotiable)
- Avoid emotional depletion the night before (difficult conversations, doom-scrolling, etc.)

**2. The Morning Of**

- Wake with enough time to regulate before starting
- Move your body (even 10 minutes changes your capacity)
- Eat substantial food (you need energy to hold space)
- Hydrate (dehydration mimics anxiety)
- Avoid starting the day with other people's problems (news, social media, drama)

**3. Before Your First Session**

Complete this checklist:

| Item | Check |
|------|-------|
| I have eaten enough to sustain energy | ☐ |
| I have hydrated | ☐ |
| I have moved my body today | ☐ |
| I am not carrying unprocessed material from my life | ☐ |
| I know who I'm seeing today | ☐ |
| I have reviewed any notes I need | ☐ |
| My physical space is ready | ☐ |
| I have taken three conscious breaths | ☐ |

### Before Each Individual Session

**The 5-Minute Reset**

Between sessions, you need to:
1. Complete the previous session
2. Clear your field
3. Prepare for the next person

**Step 1: Close the Last Session (1 minute)**

After the client leaves:
- Take three deep breaths
- Say internally: "That session is complete."
- Physically shake your hands (discharge)
- Stand up and move briefly

**Step 2: Clear Your Field (2 minutes)**

Choose one or more:
- Wash your hands with cold water
- Step outside briefly (even 30 seconds of outdoor air)
- Do a brief body scan (where am I holding tension?)
- Shake or stretch
- Open a window

**Step 3: Prepare for the Next Person (2 minutes)**

- Glance at notes (who is coming?)
- Set intention (what does this person need today?)
- Return to center (I am here. I am present. I am ready.)
- Three grounding breaths

---

### The Transition Ritual

Create your own ritual for transitioning between sessions. This trains your nervous system to reset.

**Example rituals:**

*The Water Ritual:* Wash hands between every session. Feel the water. Let it represent cleansing.

*The Breath Ritual:* Three physiological sighs (double inhale, long exhale) between sessions.

*The Movement Ritual:* Stand and stretch, shake hands and arms, return to seat.

*The Threshold Ritual:* Step out of the room and back in. The threshold represents a boundary.

*The Sound Ritual:* Ring a small chime or bell after each session. The sound marks completion.

**Your personal ritual:**

## Part II: During-Session Hygiene

### Maintaining Your Ground

While holding space, you need to stay grounded in your own body—not just tracking them.

**Periodic Self-Checks (Every 10-15 Minutes)**

Ask yourself:
- Where am I in my body right now?
- Am I breathing?
- Am I tensing anywhere?
- Am I in my seat or leaning too far into their field?
- Am I feeling their feelings or my own?

**Physical Grounding Cues**

- Feel your feet on the floor
- Feel your seat in the chair
- Notice the temperature of the air
- Feel your hands (where are they?)
- Take a conscious breath

### Staying Separate While Connected

The goal is *empathy without absorption.*

**Signs You're Absorbing:**
- Taking on their posture unconsciously
- Feeling their emotions as your own
- Losing track of your own body
- Breathing in sync with their dysregulation
- Tensing where they're tensing
- Leaving sessions exhausted rather than engaged

**Corrective Actions:**
- Shift your posture slightly (reclaim your body)
- Take a breath that's different from theirs
- Feel your feet on the ground
- Remind yourself: "Their feeling is theirs."
- Open your peripheral vision (breaks tunnel vision absorption)

### The Witness Position

Hold yourself in witness consciousness:

*I am here. They are there.*
*Their experience is theirs to have.*
*I am present without being consumed.*
*My compassion doesn't require me to suffer.*

### When You're Getting Activated

Signs your own material is arising:
- Strong emotional reaction beyond empathy
- The urge to rescue or fix
- Irritation or impatience
- Wanting to disclose your own experience
- Shutting down or dissociating
- Racing thoughts about the "right" thing to say

**In-Session Regulation:**
1. Feel your feet
2. Take a slow breath
3. Name internally: "I'm getting activated."
4. Return to curiosity: "What's happening for them?"
5. Note for supervision/processing later

---

## Part III: Session Boundaries

### The Container

A session needs a container—clear boundaries that create safety for both of you.

**Time Boundaries**

- Start on time (respects both of you)
- End on time (even if they're mid-revelation)
- Build in buffer time between sessions
- Don't let sessions run long repeatedly

**Scripts for ending on time:**

*"I'm aware we're coming to the end of our time. I want to make sure we close well."*

*"We have about five minutes left. Is there anything important you want to make sure we touch on?"*

*"I know this feels unfinished. Let's name what to come back to next time."*

*"I'm going to hold the boundary on time—not because this isn't important, but because you deserve a consistent container."*

**Space Boundaries**

- Create a physical space that supports your work
- Clear the space between sessions
- Your space should feel like neutral ground, not your personal home

**Role Boundaries**

- You are their guide/therapist/coach—not their friend
- You don't owe them access outside sessions
- You don't need to be available 24/7
- Your role has limits, and those limits are protective

### What Belongs In Session

| In Session | Outside Session |
|------------|-----------------|
| Their process | Your personal life |
| Their emotions | Your emotions (unless relevant disclosure) |
| Their growth | Friendship dynamics |
| Their stories | Social chitchat |
| Your professional guidance | Advice about your own life |

### What Stays In Session

**For them:**
- What they share is confidential
- You hold it, not carry it
- You remember, but you don't ruminate

**For you:**
- Your reactions are for supervision, not them
- Your material gets processed elsewhere
- Your boundaries are not negotiable

---

## Part IV: Post-Session Hygiene

### Immediately After Each Session

**The 2-Minute Discharge**

Before anything else:
1. **Breathe:** Three deep breaths
2. **Shake:** Shake hands, arms, whole body briefly
3. **Name:** "That session is complete."
4. **Note:** Write one line of what stood out (optional)
5. **Transition:** Do your ritual before the next session

### After Your Last Session of the Day

**The 10-Minute Decompression**

Do not go directly from sessions to life. You need a buffer.

**Options:**
- Walk for 10 minutes (movement discharges)
- Sit quietly (process what's moving)
- Journal briefly (put it on paper, not in your body)
- Call a peer (connection regulates)
- Do something completely unrelated (break state)

### Leaving Work at Work

**Physical Markers**

Create physical transitions that help you leave:
- Change clothes when you get home
- Shower after work (wash the day off)
- Have a specific spot where you check notes—not in bed
- Close laptop/phone notifications after hours

**Mental Markers**

Create mental transitions:
- "I am done for today."
- "What happened in sessions is not mine to carry home."
- "I can be present for my own life now."
- Visualize closing a door on the day's work

**What to Do With What Lingers**

If a session stays with you:
1. Write it down (externalize it)
2. Talk to a peer or supervisor (don't hold it alone)
3. Ask: "Is this about them or about me?"
4. If it's about you: take it to your own therapy
5. If it's about them: trust the process and let go

## Part V: Caseload Hygiene

### How Many Is Too Many?

There's no universal number, but there are signs you've exceeded your capacity:

**Warning signs:**
- Dreading sessions
- Forgetting clients' details
- Feeling numb during sessions
- Unable to be present with family/friends after work
- Physical symptoms (headaches, tension, exhaustion)
- Needing substances to unwind
- Sunday night dread

### The Sustainable Caseload

Consider these factors:

| Factor | Increases Capacity | Decreases Capacity |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Sleep | Good sleep | Poor sleep |
| Exercise | Regular movement | Sedentary |
| Nutrition | Adequate fuel | Skipping meals |
| Support | Regular supervision | Isolated practice |
| Variety | Mix of client intensity | All high-intensity |
| Life | Stable personal life | Personal crisis |
| Experience | More seasoned | Early career |
| Self-care | Strong practices | Neglected self |

### Building Recovery Into Your Schedule

- Don't schedule back-to-back high-intensity sessions
- Build in empty slots for catch-up
- Protect at least one day with fewer sessions
- Schedule your own therapy/supervision as non-negotiable
- Take vacations (actually take them)

---

## Part VI: Long-Term Hygiene

### Weekly Practices

| Practice | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| Supervision or peer consultation | You can't see your own blind spots |
| Movement/exercise | Discharges accumulated stress |
| Time in nature | Regulates the nervous system |
| Non-work connection | Reminds you that you're a person |
| Rest | Capacity requires recovery |

### Monthly Practices

- Review: Which clients are activating me most?
- Assess: Am I carrying anything that isn't mine?
- Check: How is my caseload feeling?
- Adjust: What needs to change?

### Quarterly Practices

- Vacation or extended break
- Deeper review of practice sustainability
- Check-in with supervisor about patterns
- Professional development (refills the well)

### Yearly Practices

- Significant time off
- Review: Is this work still right for me?
- Assess burnout risk
- Recalibrate caseload and boundaries

---

## Part VII: When You've Absorbed Something

It happens. Despite best practices, you'll sometimes carry something home.

### Signs You've Absorbed

- Intrusive thoughts about a client
- Dreaming about their material
- Feeling their emotions as your own
- Physical symptoms after sessions
- Unusual fatigue or heaviness
- Preoccupation you can't shake

### What to Do

**Immediately:**
1. Name it: "I absorbed something."
2. Don't judge yourself
3. Do a grounding practice (feet, breath, cold water)
4. Move your body (shake, walk, stretch)

**Soon:**
1. Talk to a peer or supervisor
2. Journal about what you absorbed
3. Ask: "What's mine in this? What's theirs?"
4. Take it to your own therapy if it persists

**Long-term:**
1. Identify what made you vulnerable to absorption
2. Strengthen your practices
3. Consider if this client requires additional boundaries
4. Trust that you can release what isn't yours

### The Release Practice

When you've absorbed something:

1. Sit quietly. Feel your body.
2. Locate where the absorbed material lives (often chest, stomach, shoulders)
3. Breathe into that space
4. Say internally: "This is not mine. I release it with compassion."
5. Visualize it leaving your body (through breath, through grounding into earth)
6. Say: "I return this to its source. I keep only what is mine."
7. Rest

## Integration

Session hygiene isn't about rigidity. It's about sustainability.

You cannot help people for decades if you burn out in years.

You cannot hold space if you've abandoned yourself.

You cannot pour from an empty cup.

These practices are not optional extras. They are the foundation that makes your work possible.

*The most powerful thing you bring to any session is your grounded, regulated, present self. Protect that.*

---

*"I am the instrument. Instruments require care. My hygiene is not selfish—it is the foundation of service."*
