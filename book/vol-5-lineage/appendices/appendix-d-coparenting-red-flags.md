# Appendix D: Red Flags in Co-Parenting Situations

## Recognizing Problematic Patterns With a Difficult Co-Parent

---

Co-parenting after leaving a toxic relationship is one of the hardest things you will ever do.

You left to protect yourself. Now you're legally bound to coordinate with someone who may still be manipulating, controlling, or undermining you—often through your children.

This appendix helps you recognize warning signs, protect your children, set boundaries, and maintain your own healing while navigating this complex terrain.

**A necessary note:** This appendix describes patterns, not diagnoses. Not every difficult co-parent is narcissistic. Sometimes high-conflict co-parenting reflects two people who bring out the worst in each other. Use this guide to identify patterns that require attention—not to pathologize your co-parent.

---

## Normal Conflict vs. Concerning Patterns

All co-parenting involves some friction. The question is whether the patterns are within normal bounds or indicate something more concerning.

### Normal Co-Parenting Conflict

- Disagreement about parenting decisions
- Occasional scheduling conflicts
- Different rules at different houses
- Tension during transitions
- Occasional frustrated communication
- Difficulty adjusting to the new normal
- Moments of resentment or grief

**Characteristics:** Generally resolved through communication. Both parents prioritize children's wellbeing. Conflict decreases over time.

---

### Concerning Co-Parenting Patterns

- One parent consistently undermines the other
- Children used as messengers or spies
- Persistent boundary violations
- Legal threats used as control
- Financial manipulation
- Repeated violations of custody agreements
- Children returning dysregulated or reporting troubling things
- One parent coaching children against the other

**Characteristics:** Doesn't improve with communication. One parent seems more interested in winning than in children's wellbeing. Conflict escalates or stays constant over time.

## Red Flags in Your Child's Behavior

Children can't tell you directly that something is wrong in the co-parenting dynamic. Watch for these signs:

### After Visits or Transitions

**Regression:**
- Returning to earlier developmental behaviors (bedwetting, thumb-sucking, baby talk)
- Increased clinginess or separation anxiety
- Sleep disturbances

**Dysregulation:**
- Tantrums or meltdowns beyond typical
- Aggression or withdrawal
- Hypervigilance or jumpiness

**Behavioral changes:**
- Testing boundaries more intensely
- Reenacting concerning scenarios in play
- Changes in appetite or eating patterns

---

### In Their Language

**Parroting adult language:**
- Using phrases that don't sound like them
- Repeating specific accusations or narratives
- Saying things like "Dad says you..." or "Mom told me that..."

**Loyalty binds:**
- "I can't tell you, Dad would be mad"
- "Don't tell Mom I said that"
- Visible anxiety about sharing information from the other home

**Role confusion:**
- Taking care of the other parent emotionally
- Reporting on the other parent's dating life, finances, or feelings
- Expressing worry about the other parent

---

### In Their Emotions

**Splitting:**
- Idealizing one parent while devaluing the other
- Narratives that seem too black-and-white
- Sudden shifts in allegiance

**Anxiety:**
- Worry about what they say being reported
- Fear of making one parent angry
- Stress around transitions or phone calls

**Guilt:**
- Feeling responsible for parent's feelings
- Apologizing for having fun with you
- Torn about loyalty

---

### Warning: What NOT to Do

When you see concerning signs:

**DON'T:**
- Interrogate your child about the other home
- Ask them to report on the other parent
- Express your distress to them about what they've shared
- Tell them the other parent is bad/wrong/lying
- Use them to send messages to the other parent

**DO:**
- Listen without leading questions
- Validate their feelings without interpretation
- Document factually (see below)
- Consult a professional if needed
- Maintain your home as a stable, low-conflict space

---

## Documentation Practices

If you're in a high-conflict co-parenting situation, documentation is essential—but it must be done correctly.

### What to Document

- Violations of custody order (dates, times, specifics)
- Concerning statements from children (exact quotes, context)
- Communication that is threatening, harassing, or manipulative
- Patterns over time (not just single incidents)
- Your child's behavioral changes after visits
- Witnesses to concerning events

### How to Document

**The FACT Method:**

- **F**acts only (no interpretation or emotion)
- **A**ctual date and time
- **C**ontext (what preceded and followed)
- **T**imestamped (written within 24 hours)

**Example entry:**

*Incorrect:*
"He was being a controlling jerk again and brought kids back an hour late to mess with me."

*Correct:*
"March 15, 2024, 7:45pm. Custody order states return time of 6:00pm. Children returned at 7:15pm. No advance notice given. When I texted at 6:30pm asking for ETA, received response 'traffic' at 7:00pm. Third late return this month (also March 3 and March 8)."

---

### Documentation Tools

- A dedicated notebook or document for this purpose only
- Email to yourself (creates timestamp)
- App designed for co-parenting documentation
- Screenshots of messages (with dates visible)
- Calendar tracking of custody violations

### What Documentation is FOR

- Your own clarity about patterns
- Providing accurate information to attorneys or courts if needed
- Sharing with therapists for context
- Protection if false allegations are made

### What Documentation is NOT

- Something to share with your children
- Ammunition for arguments with your co-parent
- Evidence to collect obsessively
- A replacement for living your life

## Boundary Scripts for Co-Parenting

### Limiting Communication

**When they want to argue:**
"I'm not going to engage in this conversation. If you have a logistics question about the kids, text me."

**When they bring up the past:**
"I'm focused on co-parenting. I'm not discussing our relationship."

**When they want immediate response:**
"I respond to non-emergency texts within 24 hours. I'll get back to you."

**When they demand phone calls:**
"I prefer to communicate in writing. Please text or email me."

---

### Responding to Violations

**When they violate the custody order:**
"The order states [specific term]. I expect compliance going forward."

**When they change plans unilaterally:**
"That doesn't work for me. We'll stick to the agreed schedule."

**When they make threats:**
"I won't respond to threats. My attorney is copied."

**When they criticize your parenting:**
"How I parent during my time isn't up for discussion."

---

### Protecting Children

**When they ask you to interrogate the child:**
"I won't question [child] about their time with you. If you have concerns, address them through proper channels."

**When they send messages through the child:**
"Please communicate directly with me, not through [child]."

**When they request information through the child:**
"[Child] won't be our messenger. Text me directly."

---

### De-escalation

**When they're escalating:**
"I'm going to end this conversation now. I'll respond when things are calmer."

**When they want to fight in front of children:**
"We're not doing this here. We can discuss this when the kids aren't present."

**When they won't let you leave:**
"This conversation is over. Goodbye."

---

### The Gray Rock Technique

When dealing with a high-conflict co-parent, become boring.

**What it looks like:**
- Short, factual responses
- No emotional engagement
- No justification or explanation
- No taking the bait

**Example exchange:**

Them: "You're being ridiculous about the schedule again. You always do this. The kids told me they hate being at your house."

You: "Pick-up is at 5pm as scheduled. See you then."

**Why it works:**
People who thrive on conflict need engagement to continue. When you don't provide it, the interaction ends faster.

## When to Involve Professionals

### Involve an Attorney When:

- Custody order is repeatedly violated
- Threats of false allegations are made
- Your co-parent is interfering with your custodial time
- Changes to custody need to be formally addressed
- You need a restraining order
- Financial obligations aren't being met

### Involve a Therapist For Your Child When:

- Behavioral changes persist
- Your child is expressing distress
- There are signs of parental alienation
- Your child needs a safe space to process
- Professional documentation of child's experience may be needed

### Involve a Therapist For Yourself When:

- Co-parenting is reactivating your trauma
- You're having difficulty maintaining boundaries
- You need support not available from friends/family
- You're struggling to separate your history from current parenting
- You need help not putting your children in the middle

### Consider a Parenting Coordinator When:

- High conflict persists despite court orders
- You need a neutral third party for decisions
- Communication is completely broken down
- The court recommends or requires one

## Protecting Your Child Without Alienation

This is the tightrope: protecting your child from a difficult co-parent without becoming the alienating parent yourself.

### The Principles

1. **Your child loves the other parent.** Even if that parent is harmful, your child likely loves them. Attacking the parent attacks part of your child.

2. **Truth can wait.** Your child will understand more as they grow. You don't need to explain everything now.

3. **Your behavior is your message.** When you stay calm, regulated, and honest, you teach through example.

4. **They're watching.** Children ultimately see patterns over time. You don't need to point them out.

---

### What to Say When Children Report Concerning Things

**"Dad said you're the reason our family broke up."**

"I'm sorry that was said. That must be confusing. The truth is, grownups sometimes have problems, and it's never a kid's fault."

**"Mom says you don't pay for things."**

"I understand she said that. Our money stuff is between the grownups. You don't need to worry about it."

**"Why does Dad hate you?"**

"I don't know what's in his heart. What I know is that I love you, and I'll always be here for you."

---

### What NOT to Do

- Correct every inaccuracy they report from the other home
- Ask probing questions about the other parent
- Express anger about the other parent to your child
- Cry to your child about how hard co-parenting is
- Promise to "get back" at the other parent
- Refuse to let your child love the other parent

---

### What TO Do

- Validate emotions without validating misinformation
- Create stability in your home
- Seek professional help when needed
- Process your own feelings with adults
- Let your consistency speak for itself
- Trust that truth emerges over time

---

## Self-Care While Co-Parenting With Difficulty

Co-parenting with a difficult ex is its own trauma trigger. It can reactivate everything you thought you'd healed.

### Acknowledge the Reality

- This is hard.
- You're doing something incredibly challenging.
- It's normal to feel triggered, exhausted, and overwhelmed.
- You can't fully separate from someone you share children with.

### Build Your Support

- Therapy with someone who understands high-conflict co-parenting
- Support group (in person or online) for similar situations
- Friends who don't require you to justify your boundaries
- Legal support when needed
- Family who respects your boundaries

### Protect Your Nervous System

**Before exchanges:**
- Regulate (see Appendix C)
- Lower expectations
- Have a plan for after

**During exchanges:**
- Gray rock
- Keep it brief
- Stay regulated in front of children

**After exchanges:**
- Debrief with a trusted adult
- Don't rehash with children
- Self-care practice

### Maintain Your Healing

Your healing work (Volumes 1-4) is more important, not less, in this context.

- Continue therapy or healing practices
- Don't let co-parenting become your entire identity
- Remember you're breaking the chain for your children
- Celebrate small wins
- Give yourself grace for the hard days

---

## Signs You May Need to Reassess Custody

There are situations where the current custody arrangement may need to change. Consider legal consultation if:

- Your child is in physical danger
- There is active substance abuse affecting parenting
- Neglect is occurring during custody time
- Your child is being sexually abused or witnessing abuse
- Parental alienation is occurring (documented pattern)
- Your child is expressing fear or refusal consistently
- Mental health issues are significantly impacting parenting

**Important:** Courts move slowly and require evidence. Document everything. Consult an attorney before taking action.

---

## What You Can Control

In high-conflict co-parenting, much is outside your control. Focus on what you can control:

**You CAN control:**
- Your own behavior
- Your home environment
- Your responses to your co-parent
- Your relationship with your children
- Your healing journey
- Your boundaries
- Your self-care
- Who you allow into your support circle

**You CANNOT control:**
- Your co-parent's behavior
- What happens at the other home
- What your co-parent says about you
- How your children feel about the other parent
- Court timelines
- Other people's perceptions
- Your co-parent's healing

---

## A Final Word

Co-parenting with a difficult ex can feel like an endless trigger.

But remember: every exchange you handle with dignity, every boundary you hold, every time you don't take the bait, every moment you refuse to put your child in the middle—you are breaking the chain.

Your children are watching. Not just the conflict—but how you handle it.

They will carry that with them far longer than they'll carry the memory of any single argument.

You are doing impossible work with dignity. That matters.

*"I cannot control my co-parent. I can only control who I am when I show up for my children."*
