## Diana's Developmental Questions (25 Questions)

### Part I: Structural Architecture

**Q1: Part Structure (3-part, 4-part, or 5-part)**
- [x] A) Five distinct parts
- [ ] B) Four strategic parts
- [ ] C) Three mega-parts
- [ ] D) Other: _______________

**Reasoning:** Author chose five distinct parts as shown in the current TOC. This provides more breathing room for readers navigating complex material.

---

**Q2: Chapter 10 Positioning (Advanced Warning)**
- [ ] A) Keep as "advanced" content
- [x] B) Move earlier in Part II
- [ ] C) Split across the book
- [ ] D) Make truly optional

**Reasoning:** Author decided to remove the "advanced" content label and move Chapter 10 earlier in Part II. This provides foundational understanding for subsequent dynamics rather than treating it as optional material.

---

**Q3: Decoder Cards Structure**
- [ ] A) Three chapters (current)
- [x] B) One comprehensive chapter
- [ ] C) Appendix placement
- [ ] D) Dual presentation

**Reasoning:** Author chose to consolidate decoder cards into one comprehensive chapter with internal divisions. This makes the cards easier to reference while maintaining organization through internal structure.

**⚠️ FLAG:** Reviewer noted decoder card count discrepancy—need to clarify whether playbook contains 38 or 50 tactical elements.

---

**Q4: Exposure Questions Positioning**
- [x] A) Move much earlier
- [ ] B) Move to appendix
- [ ] C) Integrate into Chapter 5
- [ ] D) Keep current position, reframe

**Reasoning:** Author decided to relocate exposure questions much earlier in the manuscript. This allows them to function as a confirmation tool before readers dive deep into specific dynamics.

---

**Q5: Crisis Reading Paths**
- [ ] A) Design for crisis readers
- [ ] B) Design for sequential readers
- [x] C) Dual design

**Reasoning:** Implied by author's broader responses—book should serve both crisis readers and sequential readers.


---

### Part II: Theme & Arc

**Q6: "Body Knows First" — Central or Supporting?**
- [ ] A) Central theme
- [x] B) Supporting motif
- [ ] C) Needs more integration
- [ ] D) Needs less emphasis

**Reasoning:** Author chose to keep "Body Knows First" as a supporting motif rather than the central organizing principle. The current balance is appropriate—body wisdom appears throughout without dominating.

---

**Q7: Sovereignty Arc**
- [ ] A) Introduce in Chapter 1
- [x] B) Develop progressively
- [ ] C) Keep as revelation
- [ ] D) Save for Volume 3

**Reasoning:** Author decided to develop the sovereignty arc progressively throughout the book. Micro-sovereignty moments will appear throughout, building toward the fuller expression in Chapter 19.

---

**Q8: "Control Disguised as Care" Frame**
- [ ] A) Expand broadly
- [ ] B) Add to the frame
- [ ] C) Make more specific
- [x] D) Keep as-is

**Reasoning:** Author chose to maintain the current framing. "Care" remains the primary disguise addressed in the patterns covered.

---

**Q9: Healing vs. Recognition Balance**
- [ ] A) Primarily RECOGNITION
- [ ] B) RECOGNITION + HEALING
- [x] C) RECOGNITION + RESPONSE
- [ ] D) Other: _______________

**Reasoning:** Author confirmed the RECOGNITION + RESPONSE balance. The book takes readers from confusion to clarity with response tools, while deeper healing work continues in subsequent volumes.

---

**Q10: Trauma Bond Explanation**
- [x] A) One comprehensive explanation
- [ ] B) Context-specific applications
- [ ] C) Layered explanation
- [ ] D) Tool-focused

**Reasoning:** Author chose to maintain one comprehensive trauma bond explanation in Chapter 4, with references elsewhere. This provides a solid foundation readers can return to.


---

### Part III: Pacing & Reader Experience

**Q11: Family Section Length**
- [x] A) Keep four chapters
- [ ] B) Consolidate to three
- [ ] C) Consolidate to two
- [ ] D) Make some appendix content

**Reasoning:** Author decided to retain all four family chapters. Family narcissism is complex and serves as a foundation for understanding vulnerability to other narcissists—this material deserves deep coverage.

---

**Q12: Playbook Length (38 Tactics)**
- [x] A) Keep all 38
- [ ] B) Highlight "Core 12"
- [ ] C) Tier the presentation
- [ ] D) Cross-reference to decoder cards

**Reasoning:** Implied by other decisions—comprehensive coverage is a feature of this volume. The full 38 tactics remain.

---

**Q13: Romantic Manipulation Chapter Balance**
- [x] A) Add healthy romance content
- [x] B) Add mid-level narcissism content
- [ ] C) Split into two chapters
- [ ] D) Keep danger-focused

**Reasoning:** Author chose BOTH options A and B. The chapter should include healthy romance content (so readers know what they're moving toward) AND mid-level narcissism perspectives (relationships that are harmful but not dangerous). Readers in mid-level narcissistic relationships should feel seen.

---

**Q14: Pause Files**
- [ ] A) Keep as separate files
- [x] B) Integrate into chapter endings
- [ ] C) Make more prominent
- [ ] D) Add mid-chapter pauses
- [ ] E) Remove them

**Reasoning:** Author decided to integrate pause files into chapter endings. This makes pauses more natural and less skippable while maintaining the breathing room they provide.

---

**Q15: Chapter Length Variation**
- [ ] A) Normalize lengths
- [x] B) Embrace variation
- [ ] C) Add more chapters
- [ ] D) Use subsections more

**Reasoning:** Author chose to embrace chapter length variation. Some topics are naturally bigger than others, and readers can handle this variation.


---

### Part IV: Content Scope & Depth

**Q16: "Not Everything Is Narcissism" Boundary**
- [x] A) Add chapter/section
- [ ] B) Expand existing notes
- [ ] C) Trust reader judgment
- [ ] D) Add to appendix

**Reasoning:** Author decided to add a dedicated chapter or section on non-narcissistic dynamics. This helps readers calibrate and discern—preventing over-identification while maintaining pattern recognition skills.

---

**Q17: Co-Parenting Gap**
- [x] A) Add section or chapter
- [ ] B) Add to appendix
- [ ] C) Reference outside resources
- [ ] D) Intentionally exclude
- [ ] E) Save for Volume 5

**Reasoning:** Author decided to include a co-parenting section. Many readers share children with narcissists, and practical co-parenting strategies belong in this foundational volume.

---

**Q18: Workplace Narcissism**
- [x] A) Expand Chapter 12
- [ ] B) Add workplace chapter
- [ ] C) Create workplace decoder cards
- [ ] D) Keep brief

---

**Q19: Spiritual/Energetic Language**
- [ ] A) Lean in fully
- [ ] B) Pull back
- [ ] C) Create two tracks
- [x] D) Stay balanced

**Reasoning:** Author decided to maintain balanced spiritual language. The current mix serves a broad audience without diluting the unique voice or limiting reach.

---

**Q20: Recovery Timeline**
- [ ] A) Add explicit timeline guidance
- [ ] B) Avoid timelines
- [ ] C) Provide ranges
- [x] D) Phase-based not time-based

**Reasoning:** Author chose phase-based rather than time-based recovery guidance. Describing phases allows readers to assess their position without creating pressure from arbitrary timelines.


---

### Part V: Reader Journey & Genre

**Q21: Primary Reader Persona**
- [x] A) Crisis reader (mild)
- [x] B) Confusion reader
- [x] C) Recovery reader
- [x] D) Learning reader

**Reasoning:** Author chose to target MULTIPLE reader personas: mild crisis readers alongside confusion, recovery, and learning readers. The book serves several journey stages rather than optimizing for just one.

---

**Q22: Tone Shifts**
- [ ] A) Preserve variation
- [ ] B) Normalize to single voice
- [ ] C) Make shifts explicit
- [x] D) Create voice consistency while preserving purpose shifts

**Reasoning:** Author chose to create voice consistency while preserving purpose shifts. The underlying voice should feel unified even as the content purpose changes between chapters.

---

**Q23: Teaching vs. Testimony Balance**
- [x] A) Teaching primary
- [ ] B) Testimony primary
- [ ] C) Equal blend
- [ ] D) Instruction primary

**Reasoning:** Author prioritized teaching. This is a research-based guide with personal credibility, not a memoir that teaches through story.

---

**Q24: Relationship to 8-Volume Series**
- [ ] A) Strong standalone
- [ ] B) Intentional bridge
- [x] C) Modular approach
- [ ] D) Series arc

**Reasoning:** Author chose a modular approach supporting both standalone and series reading. Each volume serves different readers at different stages, and someone who only reads Volume 1 should feel they received something complete.

- [ ] B) Professional resource
- [x] C) Clinical-quality self-help
- [ ] D) Workbook/guide
