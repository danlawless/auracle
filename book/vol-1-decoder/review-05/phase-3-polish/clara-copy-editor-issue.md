## Overview

I'm Clara, and I read for consistency. Every term should mean the same thing throughout. Every format should follow the same pattern. Every cross-reference should point somewhere real. I've reviewed the structural and content changes from Phase 1 and Phase 2 decisions, checking for style consistency, terminology alignment, and formatting standards.

**Why this phase matters:** Inconsistency creates cognitive load. When terms shift meaning or formats change without reason, readers work harder to follow the content. Consistency creates trust - readers know what to expect.

### Q9: Cross-Reference Format - New Module Structure

**Context:** Module restructuring (1.5 bridge, 3.1a/b splits, Module 6) creates new cross-reference needs.

**Current Format:**
- "As we discussed in Lesson 2.3..."
- "(see Lesson 4.5)"

**The Question:** How should cross-references to new/split lessons be formatted?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Continue current format: "Lesson 3.1a" or "Module 6, Lesson 6.1"
- [ ] B) Title-based: "As we discussed in The Biology of Attachment..."
- [ ] C) Hybrid: Lesson number with title on first mention, number only after
- [ ] D) Relative: "the previous lesson" / "the next lesson" where possible

**Clara's Finding:**
Current cross-references are number-based. New lesson numbers (1.5, 3.1a, 6.1) should follow same pattern.

**Clara's Preference:** A or C - Number-based with possible title clarification

- Module 5: 115 min
- **Total: ~10 hours**

**The Question:** Should module duration estimates be updated after restructuring?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Recalculate all durations based on new lesson structure
- [ ] B) Keep approximate durations, note they may vary
- [ ] C) Remove duration estimates: "progress at your own pace"
- [ ] D) Add Module 6 duration, adjust others as needed

**Clara's Finding:**
With new lessons (1.5, 3.1a/b, 5.4/5.5, Module 6), total duration likely increases to 11-12 hours. Estimates need updating.

**Clara's Preference:** A - Recalculate for accuracy

### Q12: Lesson Numbering After Splits

**Context:** Lesson 3.1 becomes 3.1a/3.1b. Lesson 5.4 becomes 5.4/5.5. New bridge lesson 1.5.

**The Question:** What numbering convention for split lessons?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Letter suffixes: 3.1a, 3.1b (preserves original numbering)
- [ ] B) Renumber module: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3... (shifts all subsequent)
- [ ] C) Decimal extension: 3.1.1, 3.1.2 (technical but clear)
- [ ] D) Title-based: Remove numbers, use lesson titles as primary reference

**Clara's Finding:**
Letter suffixes (a/b) are clearest for indicating related content that was split. Renumbering creates widespread cross-reference updates.

**Clara's Preference:** A - Letter suffixes to minimize disruption

"Ready for more? Continue to Lesson X.X: [Title]"

**The Question:** Verify all "Next Lesson" references are accurate after restructuring.

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Update all Next Lesson references to new structure
- [ ] B) Remove Next Lesson references: Let course navigation handle it
- [ ] C) Add Previous/Next lesson references to all lessons
- [ ] D) Keep Next only, verify accuracy

**Clara's Finding:**
All lessons have "Next" references. These become inaccurate with restructuring. Systematic update needed.

**Clara's Preference:** A or D - Update existing references

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Lesson 1.4 → 1.5 (new bridge)
- [ ] Lesson 1.5 → 2.1
