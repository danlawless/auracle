# Chapter 8: Scope of Practice — Know Your Lane

## The Difference Between What You Can Do and What You Should Do

---

You have helped people.

Real people with real problems have been genuinely helped by your presence, your insight, your care.

But here's the question that separates sustainable helping from dangerous helping:

**Where do your capabilities end?**

Not your desires. Not your willingness. Not your confidence.

Your actual, legitimate scope of practice.

This chapter is about knowing your lane—and why staying in it is not a limitation, but an ethics.

## Field Note (Before): The Coach Who Went Too Deep

She was a good coach. Her clients made progress. She had testimonials, referrals, a growing practice.

Then she got a client who presented with "life transition issues."

It started that way. But by session four, the client was describing childhood abuse. By session six, dissociative episodes. By session eight, suicidal ideation.

The coach didn't stop.

She told herself she was helping. The client trusted her. Referring out would feel like abandonment. She had been through her own trauma—she understood this terrain.

So she kept going. Kept listening. Kept trying to help with something she wasn't trained to hold.

Until one night, the client called her at 2 AM in crisis, and she realized she had no idea what to do.

She had gone too deep. She was in over her head. And the client—who had trusted her—was now in a situation where the help she needed was beyond what the coach could provide.

The coach wasn't bad. She was beyond her scope.

And beyond your scope is where harm lives.

---

## Field Note (After): The Coach Who Knew Her Lane

Same coach. Different year.

A new client presents with anxiety about a career change. After a few sessions, the client mentions past trauma.

This time, the coach pauses.

"What you're describing sounds really important—and it's beyond what coaching can address. Have you worked with a therapist on this?"

The client hadn't. The coach made a referral.

She continued seeing the client—for coaching, about career. The trauma work happened with a clinician trained to hold it.

The client got both: practical support for their career, clinical support for their trauma. Neither provider overreached. Both stayed in their lane.

This is ethical helping.

---

## What Is Scope of Practice?

Scope of practice refers to the boundaries of what a helper is qualified, trained, and legally authorized to do.

For licensed professionals, this is often legally defined: what your license covers, what training you've completed, what you can ethically claim competence in.

For unlicensed helpers—coaches, peer supporters, content creators, friends, or community guides—the concept still applies, even if there's no legal body enforcing it.

**Scope of practice includes:**

**1. Training and Credentials**

What have you actually been trained to do? Not what you've read about. Not what you've experienced personally. What have you been formally trained in?

**2. Competence**

Are you actually good at this? Not willing—competent. Do you have the skills, knowledge, and supervised experience to provide this type of help?

**3. Context**

What is your role here? Are you a therapist, coach, friend, content creator, peer supporter? Each role has different boundaries.

**4. Legal and Ethical Boundaries**

What are you legally and ethically permitted to do in your jurisdiction, your profession, your role?

**5. Personal Capacity**

Do you have the personal capacity right now to take this on? Even if you're qualified, are you in a place to handle this particular situation?

---

## Why This Matters

You might think: But I can help. They came to me. They trust me. Why turn them away?

Here's why scope matters:

**1. Harm Prevention**

When you work beyond your scope, you can cause harm—not from malice, but from incompetence. You might miss something dangerous. You might provide inadequate intervention for a serious condition. You might delay appropriate care.

Helping inadequately isn't helping. It's harm with good intentions.

**2. Client Welfare**

Your client deserves the best possible help, not just the help you can provide. Referring them to someone better suited isn't abandonment—it's advocacy.

**3. Your Protection**

Working beyond your scope exposes you to liability, burnout, and the trauma of being in over your head. Staying in your lane protects you.

**4. Professional Integrity**

Claiming competence you don't have is deceptive—even if you believe you're helping. Honesty about your limits is part of ethical practice.

**5. The Ecosystem of Care**

Healthy care ecosystems have specialists. Therapists do what therapists do. Coaches do what coaches do. Doctors do what doctors do. When everyone stays in their lane, clients get appropriate care. When helpers overreach, the ecosystem breaks down.

---

## The Spectrum of Helping Roles

Let's be clear about different roles and their boundaries:

**Licensed Therapist/Counselor**

- Trained in mental health diagnosis and treatment
- Can work with mental illness, trauma, personality disorders
- Legal and ethical responsibilities defined by licensing body
- Can assess for risk (suicide, harm to others)
- Has malpractice insurance and legal recourse frameworks

**Psychiatrist**

- Medical doctor specializing in mental health
- Can prescribe medication
- Can diagnose mental illness
- Often works alongside therapists

**Psychologist**

- Doctoral-level training in psychology
- Can diagnose; can provide therapy
- Often specializes in assessment
- May or may not be able to prescribe (depends on jurisdiction)

**Coach**

- Typically not licensed (some certifications exist)
- Works with generally healthy people on goals, performance, life transitions
- Should NOT diagnose, treat mental illness, or work with active trauma
- Focuses on forward movement, not healing the past
- No legal recourse framework (client beware)

**Peer Supporter**

- Shares their own lived experience
- Provides empathy, understanding, modeling of recovery
- Should NOT provide treatment or clinical advice
- Valuable for connection and hope, not clinical intervention

**Content Creator**

- Shares information, inspiration, frameworks
- Does NOT have a therapeutic relationship with audience
- Can educate but should not claim to treat
- Responsibility to be accurate and not harmful

**Friend**

- Offers personal support and connection
- Should NOT be the sole support for someone in crisis
- Knows when to encourage professional help
- Has no professional obligations but has relational ones

**Spiritual Director/Pastor**

- Provides spiritual guidance and support
- May have training in pastoral counseling
- Should know limits of spiritual care vs. mental health care
- Referral skills essential

Each of these roles is valuable. None of them should try to be all the others.

---

## The Danger Zones

Some situations require specific training and are dangerous to work beyond scope:

**1. Active Suicidality**

If someone is expressing suicidal thoughts, plans, or intent, this requires clinical assessment.

Unless you're trained in suicide risk assessment, your job is to:
- Take it seriously
- Help connect them to a crisis resource immediately
- Not try to "therapy" them out of it

Coaches, friends, and content creators should NOT be the primary support for suicidal individuals.

**2. Active Psychosis**

If someone is experiencing hallucinations, delusions, or severe breaks from reality, they need psychiatric care.

This is beyond coaching, peer support, and most therapy training.

**3. Active Eating Disorders**

These have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. They require specialized treatment.

Well-meaning help from unqualified people can make things worse.

**4. Severe Personality Disorders**

Working with Borderline, Narcissistic, or Antisocial Personality Disorders requires specialized training.

These presentations can be destabilizing for untrained helpers and harmful to clients if mishandled.

**5. Active Addiction**

Addiction treatment is a specialty. Motivation work, harm reduction, and treatment navigation require training.

**6. Complex Trauma / Dissociative Disorders**

Trauma work is not for beginners. Complex trauma and dissociative disorders require specialized, phased treatment.

Untrained helpers can retraumatize clients by going too deep too fast.

**7. Abuse and Violence Situations**

If someone is in an active abuse situation or presenting with domestic violence concerns, specialized advocacy and safety planning are required.

**8. Child Abuse Reporting**

If you have reasonable suspicion of child abuse, you may be a mandated reporter (depending on your role and jurisdiction). Know your obligations.

## Neuroscience Sidebar: Why Good Intentions Aren't Enough

Your brain has a bias called the Dunning-Kruger effect: the less you know about something, the more confident you may be in your knowledge.

**This is particularly dangerous in helping work because:**

1. **Emotional certainty feels like knowledge.** You feel deeply that you understand their situation—but feeling is not competence.

2. **Client gratitude reinforces overreach.** When a client thanks you for help that was beyond your scope, you feel validated—even if the help was inadequate.

3. **Pattern-matching isn't diagnosis.** Your brain sees patterns ("this looks like what I went through") but pattern recognition is not clinical assessment.

4. **You can't know what you don't know.** If you're not trained in a specialty, you may not recognize when it's needed.

**The research is clear:** Untrained helpers working with complex presentations can:
- Miss danger signs
- Provide inadequate intervention
- Delay appropriate treatment
- Retraumatize vulnerable clients
- Create false confidence that problems are being addressed

Good intentions do not create competence. Training creates competence.

## Signs You're Beyond Your Scope

**In Session:**
- You feel lost, confused, or over your head
- You don't know what to do next
- You're scared by what they're sharing
- You're making it up as you go
- You're relying on your own experience instead of training
- You're avoiding topics because you don't know how to address them
- You're feeling drained, activated, or destabilized after sessions

**In the Pattern:**
- You're taking on clients with presentations you're not trained for
- You're working with issues you've never studied formally
- You're the only support for someone who needs more
- You're providing treatment without clinical training
- Clients are getting worse, not better
- You dread sessions with certain clients

**In Your Thinking:**
- "I can help anyone"
- "Training doesn't matter as much as heart"
- "I've been through this, so I understand"
- "They trust me, so I can't refer out"
- "Referring them would feel like abandonment"
- "I'm not like those cold professionals"

Any of these? Pause. Assess. Consider whether you're in your lane.

## Field Note: The Life Coach and the Dissociative Client

He was a certified life coach with a specialty in high-performance executives.

Then a new client came—successful, articulate, goal-oriented. Perfect fit.

Except she kept "going away" in sessions. Her eyes would glaze. She'd lose track of time. She'd come back and not remember what they'd been discussing.

He didn't know what he was seeing. He tried to coach through it—more structure, more grounding exercises, more goals.

It didn't help. It got worse.

Finally, he described the situation to a therapist friend. Who said: "That sounds like dissociation. She needs trauma-specialized treatment, not coaching."

He was embarrassed. He'd spent months trying to coach what needed clinical care.

He referred her out. She got appropriate help. She came back for coaching later—after stabilization.

He learned: *What you don't know can hurt the people you're trying to help.*

## How to Know Your Lane

**Step 1: Get Clear on Your Training**

What have you actually been trained in? Not experienced. Not read about. Trained.

Make a list. Be honest.

**Step 2: Define Your Niche**

Who are you qualified to serve? What issues can you appropriately address?

A coach might say: "I work with generally healthy adults on career transitions."

A peer supporter might say: "I support people in early recovery using my own experience."

A therapist might say: "I'm trained in CBT for anxiety and depression; I refer out for trauma and personality disorders."

Get specific.

**Step 3: Know Your Referral Thresholds**

What presentations require referral?

Make a list of situations where you should not be the primary helper:
- Suicidality
- Psychosis
- Active eating disorder
- Etc.

**Step 4: Build a Referral Network**

Who can you refer to when something is beyond your scope?

Have therapists, psychiatrists, addiction specialists, crisis resources, and other professionals in your network—before you need them.

**Step 5: Consult When Uncertain**

When you're not sure if something is in your scope, consult.

Ask a supervisor, a peer, a professional in that specialty. Don't guess alone.

---

## The Art of Staying in Lane Without Abandoning

Staying in your lane doesn't mean being cold or withholding.

**It means:**

**1. Honest About Limits**

"What you're describing is beyond what coaching can address. You deserve someone trained in this. I can help you find that person."

**2. Warm Referral**

Not just throwing a phone number at them. Walking alongside them as they connect to appropriate care.

**3. Staying in Relationship (If Appropriate)**

Sometimes you can continue in your role while they also get specialized help.

Example: Continue coaching on career while they work with a therapist on trauma.

**4. Clear About What You Can Offer**

"I'm not able to help with the trauma work, but I'm here for the life transition parts. Let's coordinate with your therapist."

**5. Not Making It About You**

They may feel hurt or abandoned by referral. Don't take it personally. Don't backtrack because they're disappointed. Stay clear.

## A Practice: The Scope Inventory

For your current practice or helping work:

**Question 1:** What am I formally trained in?

List credentials, training programs, supervised experience.

**Question 2:** What is my legitimate niche?

What population and issues am I qualified to address?

**Question 3:** What issues require immediate referral?

List the presentations where you should not be the primary helper.

**Question 4:** Who is in my referral network?

List names and contact information for specialists in areas outside your scope.

**Question 5:** What situations make me feel over my head?

These might be areas where you need more training or more willingness to refer.

---

## A Practice: The Scope Check Before Intake

When a new client or person seeking help presents:

**Check 1:** Does their presentation fall within my training and niche?

**Check 2:** Are there danger signs that require clinical assessment?

**Check 3:** Am I the most appropriate resource for this person, or is there someone better?

**Check 4:** Do I have the personal capacity to take this on right now?

**Check 5:** What support would I need if I take this on?

If you can't answer these confidently, slow down before taking on the work.

---

## A Practice: The Session Scope Monitor

During sessions:

**Notice:** When do I feel confused, lost, or over my head?

**Notice:** When am I relying on my own experience instead of training?

**Notice:** When am I avoiding topics because I don't know how to address them?

**Notice:** When do I feel scared by what they're sharing?

These are signals. Attend to them. Consult. Refer if needed.

---

## The Ethics of Lived Experience

This book is partly for those helping from lived experience. So let's address this directly:

**Lived experience is valuable.** It creates understanding, connection, and hope that no training can replicate.

**Lived experience is not sufficient.** Understanding what something feels like does not make you qualified to treat it.

**Example:**

Having survived cancer gives you profound insight into the cancer experience. It makes you a valuable peer supporter.

It does not make you qualified to treat cancer.

Having survived narcissistic abuse gives you profound insight into that experience. It makes you a valuable peer supporter.

It does not make you qualified to treat complex trauma.

The two are not opposed. You can offer the gift of your experience AND recognize where clinical training is required.

---

## For the Non-Licensed Helper

If you're a coach, content creator, peer supporter, or informal helper without clinical licensing:

**You can:**
- Share your experience
- Provide information and education
- Offer support and encouragement
- Help with goal-setting and forward movement
- Listen and witness
- Point toward resources
- Hold space

**You should not:**
- Diagnose (even informally)
- Treat mental illness
- Be the sole support for someone in crisis
- Work with active suicidality
- Handle complex trauma without clinical backup
- Present yourself as equivalent to licensed professionals
- Work beyond your actual competence

The question isn't what you're allowed to do. It's what you're equipped to do responsibly.

---

## The Humility of Not Knowing

Knowing your lane requires humility.

It requires admitting: *There are things I don't know. There are situations I'm not equipped for. There are people who need more than I can give.*

This isn't failure. It's integrity.

The helper who claims to help everyone with everything is either lying or dangerously uninformed.

The helper who knows their limits is the one who can be trusted.

**Saying "this is beyond my scope" is not:**
- Weakness
- Failure
- Abandonment
- Withholding
- Coldness

**It is:**
- Honesty
- Ethics
- Protection (of them and you)
- Humility
- Advocacy (pointing them toward appropriate help)

---

## Field Note: The Integrity of the Limit

She was a trauma survivor turned peer mentor.

A newer member of the support group came to her with something serious: memories of abuse that were emerging, destabilizing symptoms, confusion and distress.

The peer mentor felt the pull to help. She had been through something similar. She understood.

But she also knew: this person needed more than peer support. They needed clinical care.

She said: "I hear you. This is real and it matters. And I want to be honest—what you're describing needs a professional. Someone trained in trauma therapy. Can I help you find that?"

The person looked hurt at first. Then relieved.

They found a therapist. The peer mentor continued to be a supportive presence. But the clinical work happened with someone equipped to hold it.

Everyone was better served.

## Reader Reflection

- What am I formally trained in?
- Where do I risk working beyond my scope?
- What presentations make me feel over my head?
- Do I have a robust referral network?
- Can I say "this is beyond my scope" without feeling like I'm failing?
- Where has my lived experience tempted me to overreach into clinical territory?

**Body cue to notice:** The fear of admitting you don't know; the pull to help anyway; the discomfort of referring out

**Practice:** The scope inventory (complete honestly)

## Closing Note for This Chapter

You want to help. That desire is precious.

But wanting to help is not the same as being qualified to help. And being willing is not the same as being equipped.

Your lane is not a prison. It's a contribution.

Every role in the helping ecosystem matters: the therapist, the coach, the peer supporter, the content creator, the friend. Each one offers something the others can't.

But each one can also cause harm by pretending to be what they're not.

Know what you're qualified to do. Do that excellently. And when something requires more, have the humility and integrity to name it.

Your clients deserve appropriate care. You deserve sustainable practice. The ecosystem deserves helpers who stay in their lane.

This isn't about being less than. It's about being honest about what you are.

And from that honesty, serving well.

*"I don't have to be everything to everyone. I have to be what I am—and know where that ends."*
