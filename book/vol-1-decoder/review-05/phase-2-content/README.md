# Review Round 5 - Phase 2: Reader Engagement Review

**Reviewer:** Bailey (Beta Reader)
**Date:** January 2026
**Status:** In Progress - Decision Templates Ready

---

## Phase 2 Overview

Bailey has completed a full read-through of all 24 course lessons and generated 25 actionable questions based on genuine reader experience. This phase focuses on:

- **Reader engagement** (where content hooks or loses attention)
- **Emotional impact** (where validation lands or misses)
- **Clarity** (where concepts need better explanation)
- **Pacing** (where content feels rushed or draggy)
- **Connection** (where readers see themselves in the material)

## Key Themes from Bailey's Review

### Content Strengths
- Core teaching is powerful and well-structured
- Decoder cards framework is brilliant
- Validation moments are deeply meaningful
- The 3-3-3 Rule and Master Question are game-changers

### Areas for Enhancement
1. **Pacing & Density:** Module 2 tactics and Module 4 cards feel overwhelming in current format
2. **Emotional Scaffolding:** Heavy content (especially 3.3 parental wounds) needs more aftercare
3. **Phase 1 Promises:** Several Phase 1 decisions aren't visible yet (50 cards, Module 6, male examples, 15-min highlights)
4. **Terminology Clarity:** Some terms (JADE, flying monkeys, trauma bonding) need earlier/clearer introduction
5. **Format Variety:** Repetitive formats create fatigue; variation would enhance engagement

### Critical Questions Requiring Decisions
- **Q3:** Card count (37 vs 50 cards promised in Phase 1)
- **Q4:** Module 6 status (mentioned in Phase 1, not in curriculum)
- **Q8:** Male-specific examples (including promised "baby trap" scenario)
- **Q25:** 15-minute highlight versions (mentioned in Phase 1, not visible)
