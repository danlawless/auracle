## Email Sequence

### Email 1: The Teaser (4 weeks before launch)

**Subject:** You asked for this...

**Body:**

When I released The Narcissism Decoder, I heard the same question over and over:

*"I can name the patterns now. But why can't I stop reacting?"*

You understood what happened. You could see the manipulation. You had the language.

And yet your body still responded as if nothing had changed.

That gap—between insight and embodiment—is where the real work lives.

It's why I wrote the second book.

**The Bridge: Learning Secure Attachment After Trauma** picks up where recognition ends. It's about healing at the nervous system level. About retraining your attachment patterns. About building relationships that regulate rather than activate.

It's coming soon.

If you want early access when it drops, just reply "BRIDGE" and I'll make sure you're first to know.

Talk soon,
[Your name]

P.S. — In the meantime, here's a preview of what we'll cover: [Link to teaser content on Substack]

### Email 2: The Excerpt (3 weeks before launch)

**Subject:** "What we call chemistry is often familiarity"

**Body:**

One of the most important chapters in The Bridge is about slow burns vs. fast burns.

Here's a preview:

---

*There's a reason unhealthy relationships often feel so intense.*

*And a reason healthy relationships can feel... boring.*

*For those who grew up in dysregulated environments:*
- *Intensity = love (that's what you knew)*
- *Anxiety = passion (that's how love felt)*
- *Quick bonding = safety (the faster you lock in, the safer you are)*

*Your nervous system seeks what it knows, not what it needs.*

*What we call "chemistry" is often familiarity.*

*What we call "boring" is often safety we haven't learned to trust yet.*

---

This reframe alone has changed how so many readers approach dating after trauma.

The full chapter includes:
- The Slow Burn Protocol (a phased approach to dating)
- How to distinguish real slow burns from avoidant distance
- Why your nervous system mistakes activation for attraction

The Bridge releases in [X] weeks.

Reply if you have questions about what's covered—I read every response.

### Email 3: The Waitlist (2 weeks before launch)

This book covers:
- Why insight alone doesn't heal (and what does)
- How childhood roles shape who you're attracted to

### Email 4: The Countdown (1 week before launch)

**Subject:** 7 days until The Bridge

**Body:**

One week from today.

The Bridge officially releases.

If you've been following along, you know what this book is about:

Closing the gap between knowing and being.

It's for the people who said:
- "I understand what happened, but I can't stop reacting"
- "I keep choosing the same patterns"
- "I know what's healthy, but it feels boring"
- "I want to date again but I don't trust myself"

Volume 1 gave you the language to recognize manipulation.

Volume 2 gives you the practice to heal from it.

**This week, I'm sharing daily content leading up to launch:**

- Monday: The Core Principles
- Tuesday: Why Insight Isn't Enough
- Wednesday: The Slow Burn Protocol
- Thursday: Reparenting Preview
- Friday: The 12-Week Training Overview
- Saturday: Reader Q&A
- Sunday: Launch Day

Follow along on [social platform] or just wait for launch day.

See you soon,
[Your name]

### Email 6: Follow-Up (3 days after launch)

**Subject:** How's the reading going?

**Body:**

The Bridge launched three days ago.

Some of you have already started. Some are waiting for the weekend. Some are still on Volume 1.

Wherever you are is right.

This is not a book to rush.

---

**Quick check-in:**

If you've started reading and have questions, just reply. I read everything.

If you haven't grabbed it yet, here's where to find it:

**One quote to sit with this week:**

> "Secure attachment is not found—it is practiced. You will not discover security in another person. You will build it in yourself through consistent, gentle practice."

That's the whole book, really.

Talk soon,
