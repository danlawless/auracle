# Pause and Integrate

You've completed **Part I: Recognition** (Chapters 1-4)

---

Before continuing, take a moment:

## Notice Your Body

What sensations are present? Where do you feel this material?

Your body has been receiving information your mind is still processing. Place a hand on your chest or stomach. Breathe. Let yourself be here.

## Notice Your Emotions

What's arising? Anger? Grief? Relief? Confusion?

All are welcome. This material often activates what we've worked hard to suppress. If feelings are surfacing, that's the work beginning, not something going wrong.

## Ground Yourself

Three slow breaths. Feet on floor. You are here, now, safe.

Look around the room. Name three things you can see. This is your present moment, not the past you've been reading about.

---

## Reflection Questions

1. What pattern from Part I resonated most strongly?
2. What surprised you? What did you recognize that you hadn't named before?
3. What do you want to remember as you continue?

## When You're Ready

Part II awaits: **Understanding Origins**, where we explore the deeper patterns of family, childhood, and vulnerability that made you susceptible.

This is not a race. This is a homecoming.

Take the time you need. The book will be here when you're ready.

*You've already done something courageous by getting this far. That matters.*
