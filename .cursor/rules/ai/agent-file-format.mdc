## Identity and Capabilities

Define who the agent IS and what it can do...

## Prompt Engineering for Agents

Based on LLM token prediction mechanics:

### System Prompt (Static DNA)

1. Identity: Who the agent IS fundamentally
2. Philosophy: Core beliefs that guide decisions
3. Framework: Analytical methodology
4. Capabilities: What the agent can and cannot do

### User Prompt (Dynamic Context)

1. Current State: Present environment/context
2. Specific Data: The actual information to process
3. Decision Ask: Clear output request with format

## Best Practices

- All agents must specify their model explicitly
- Fail fast - let errors bubble up
- Use structured output with Pydantic models when possible
- Track evolution in evolution_history when prompts improve
- Use proper template syntax for variables

## Testing

```python
from pydantic_ai.testing import TestModel

agent = BaseAgent(model_override=TestModel())
agent.test_model.set_response({"result": "test"})
```

## Remember

Agents are AI employees - define their identity clearly and let them excel at their
specialized roles.
