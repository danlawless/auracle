### Script

Let's dive into the Core Decoder Cards.

These 19 patterns represent the most common manipulation tactics you'll encounter. We'll cover the first 10 in this lesson, and the remaining 9 in the next.

For each card, I'll give you the name, what they say, what they mean, and how to respond.

---

**CARD 1: THE GASLIGHT**

**What they say:**
"That never happened."
"You're imagining things."
"I never said that."
"You're so paranoid."

**What they mean:**
"I will deny reality until you doubt yourself. Your perception is a threat to my control."

**The function:**
Destabilizes your reality testing. Creates dependency on their version of events.

**Your response:**
"I trust my memory."
"I remember it differently."
Don't argue the facts. State your perception and disengage.

---

**CARD 2: THE SHIFT**

**What they say:**
"You're overreacting."
"Why are you making such a big deal?"
"You're too sensitive."
"Normal people don't react like this."

**What they mean:**
"Your reaction is the problem, not my behavior. Let's focus on what's wrong with you."

**The function:**
Shifts focus from their behavior to your response. Makes you question your own reactions.

**Your response:**
"My reaction is information about my experience."
"I get to decide what affects me."
Don't explain your sensitivity. Keep focus on the behavior.

---

**CARD 3: THE GUILT HOOK**

**What they say:**
"After everything I've done for you..."
"You're so ungrateful."
"This is how you treat me?"
"I sacrificed so much."

**What they mean:**
"You owe me compliance. Your boundaries hurt my feelings, so drop them."

**The function:**
Creates debt that can never be repaid. Weaponizes your conscience.

**Your response:**
"I appreciate what you've done, AND I still have boundaries."
"Gratitude doesn't require abandoning my needs."
Don't apologize for having limits.

---

**CARD 4: THE COMPARISON**

**What they say:**
"My ex would never have done this."
"Other people manage just fine."
"Everyone else agrees with me."
"Normal partners don't complain like you."

**What they mean:**
"You're falling short of a standard I control. Try harder to please me."

**The function:**
Creates insecurity. Establishes them as the judge of your adequacy.

**Your response:**
"I'm not them."
"I can only be myself."
Don't compete with ghosts or imaginary standards.

---

**CARD 5: THE INTERMITTENT**

**What they say:**
Sometimes: "You're amazing. I love you so much. We're perfect together."
Other times: (Cold, distant, critical, unavailable)

**What they mean:**
"I'll keep you attached through unpredictability. Never know which version you'll get."

**The function:**
Creates addictive attachment through variable reinforcement. Bonds through chaos.

**Your response:**
Recognize the pattern, not the moments.
"Consistency matters more than peaks."
Don't chase the good version. Watch the pattern.

---

**CARD 6: THE TRIANGLE**

**What they say:**
"Your friend mentioned they're worried about you."
"Sarah agrees that you're being difficult."
"I was talking to my colleague and they said..."
"Even your mother thinks..."

**What they mean:**
"Third parties validate me and undermine you. You're alone in your perception."

**The function:**
Creates isolation. Manufactures apparent consensus. Prevents direct resolution.

**Your response:**
"What do YOU think?"
"I prefer to hear concerns directly."
Don't engage with secondhand information. Refuse triangulation.

---

**CARD 7: THE FREEZE**

**What they say:**
(Nothing. Complete withdrawal without explanation. Gone.)

**What they mean:**
"I'm punishing you through absence. Chase me. Apologize. Beg."

**The function:**
Creates panic. Forces you to abandon your position to restore connection.

**Your response:**
"When you're ready to talk, I'm here."
Don't chase. Use the space to regulate yourself.
Their silence is about them, not you.

---

**CARD 8: THE FLIP**

**What they say:**
"I'm the one who's hurt here."
"You're the abusive one."
"I can't believe you're doing this to ME."
"After what YOU did?"

**What they mean:**
"By making myself the victim, I avoid accountability for my behavior."

**The function:**
Reverses roles. Confuses the issue. Puts you on defense.

**Your response:**
"We can discuss your feelings, but first let's address [the original issue]."
Don't accept the reversal. Stay with the original topic.

---

**CARD 9: THE MINIMIZER**

**What they say:**
"It wasn't that bad."
"I barely raised my voice."
"You're making a mountain out of a molehill."
"It was just a joke."

**What they mean:**
"If I make the harm small enough, I don't have to address it."

**The function:**
Dismisses impact. Avoids accountability. Makes you feel dramatic for being affected.

**Your response:**
"It was significant enough for me to address."
"My experience is my experience."
Don't defend the size of your reaction. Impact is impact.

---

**CARD 10: THE PROMISE**

**What they say:**
"I'm going to change."
"It'll be different this time."
"Just give me another chance."
"Things will be better when..."

**What they mean:**
"Future promises cost me nothing and keep you invested."

**The function:**
Delays your departure. Harvests more of your time and energy. Maintains access.

**Your response:**
"I'll watch behavior, not words."
"Change happens in the present, not the future."
Base decisions on patterns, not promises.
