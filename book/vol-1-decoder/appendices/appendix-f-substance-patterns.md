# Appendix F: Substance-Related Patterns

> **Note:** These decoder cards address manipulation tactics involving alcohol, drugs, or other substances. They are placed in this appendix because they represent a specialized subset of patterns that may not apply to all readers but are critically important for those who encounter them.

---

## Why These Patterns Matter

Substance-related manipulation combines the dynamics of control with the complicating factor of intoxication—both theirs and potentially yours. These tactics exploit:

- **Lowered inhibitions** making you more vulnerable to agreements
- **Impaired memory** creating plausible deniability
- **Social pressure** around drinking culture
- **Shame** that keeps you from naming what happened

If you recognize these patterns, you're not alone. They're common and insidious precisely because they're harder to name.

### Field Note: The Third Glass

He refills her wine before she asks.

*"You're so tense. Just relax."*

She wasn't tense until he said that. Now she feels like she's failing at something.

By the third glass, she's softer. Easier. The edges blur.

That's when he brings up what he wants—something she said no to last week. Something that made her uncomfortable.

She hears herself agreeing. Her voice sounds far away.

The next morning, she doesn't remember exactly what she said yes to. But she remembers the feeling: cornered without walls.

When she tries to revisit the conversation sober, he says: *"You already agreed. Are you going back on your word?"*

---

### Field Note: The Pause Before the Pour

He reaches for the bottle.

She covers her glass. "I'm good."

*"Come on. One more won't hurt."*

She notices the pressure. The familiar setup. The way serious conversations always seem to happen after she's had a few.

"I said I'm good."

His face flickers—then smooths into charm. "Fine. Suit yourself."

Later, when he brings up the thing she said no to before, she's clear.

"My answer is still no."

*"You're so rigid when you're sober."*

"I know. That's the point."

## Card S-1: The Substance Shield

**The Pattern:** Using intoxication as a get-out-of-jail-free card

**What They Say/Do:**
- "I was drunk—I didn't mean it"
- "I don't even remember saying that"
- "That wasn't really me—I was wasted"
- "You know I don't mean things when I drink"
- "I can't be held responsible for what I said"

**What's Really Happening:**
Intoxication becomes blanket immunity from accountability. Whether or not they remember, the impact happened. The "drunk version" isn't a different person—it's often the unfiltered version, the one without the mask.

**The truth about "drunk words":** Alcohol lowers inhibitions. It doesn't create new personalities—it reveals what's normally suppressed.

**How It Hooks You:**
You minimize harm because "they weren't themselves." You wait for the sober version to return. You accept apologies that blame the substance rather than address the behavior. You start tracking their drinking to predict when you're "safe."

**Your Power Move:**
"Drunk or sober, you said that. The substance doesn't erase the impact."

If this is a pattern, the pattern is the problem—not any single incident. Someone who repeatedly harms you while intoxicated and claims amnesia is choosing to keep drinking despite the consequences.

> *"The mask slips when they're drunk. What you see isn't the alcohol talking—it's them, unfiltered."*

## Card S-2: Lowering Your Defenses

**The Pattern:** Important conversations when you've been drinking

**What They Say/Do:**
- "Come on, just one more"
- "You're more fun when you drink"
- "Don't be so uptight—relax"
- Initiates serious talks after you've had drinks
- Picks fights when your judgment is impaired
- Extracts agreements or admissions when you're intoxicated

**What's Really Happening:**
Your lowered inhibitions serve their purposes. When you're impaired, you're more likely to: agree to things you'd refuse sober, reveal information you'd protect, respond emotionally rather than strategically, forget details they can later deny, and be easier to gaslight.

**How It Hooks You:**
You feel like you're being social, relaxing, having fun. You don't notice you're consistently more intoxicated than them. Important decisions happen when you're not at full capacity. You wake up having agreed to things you regret—and they hold you to it.

**Your Power Move:**
"I don't make decisions when I've been drinking. We can talk about this tomorrow."

If they push: "My answer while sober is my answer."

> *"If they need you impaired to have the conversation, they need you impaired to get the answer they want."*

## Card S-3: The Functional Facade

**The Pattern:** Hidden substance abuse maintained through image management

**What They Say/Do:**
- Maintains public image of control while privately struggling
- Drinks every night but "never misses work"
- Uses daily but insists they "don't have a problem"
- Any discussion met with defensiveness, denial, or accusations about your behavior

**What's Really Happening:**
The image is what matters. As long as they maintain the appearance of functionality, they don't have to address reality. The secrecy itself becomes gaslighting—you see the consumption, but they insist there's no problem.

**The narcissistic intersection:** Substance abuse often coexists with narcissistic patterns because both involve denial of reality, projection of problems onto others, and rage when the facade is threatened.

**How It Hooks You:**
You become the secret-keeper. You manage around their use. You stop inviting certain people over. You make excuses. You question whether you're "overreacting" because they "function just fine."

**Your Power Move:**
You're not responsible for protecting their image.

"I see what I see. Your definition of 'fine' isn't mine."

You can love someone and refuse to participate in their denial. Their addiction is not yours to manage, hide, or cure.

> *"Functional addiction is still addiction. The mask of competence doesn't erase the chaos you absorb behind closed doors."*

## Card S-4: Weaponizing Your Use

**The Pattern:** Your substance history becomes ammunition

**What They Say/Do:**
- Tracking and cataloguing your drinking or use
- "You were drunk that night, so your memory can't be trusted"
- "You've had a glass of wine, so you're not thinking clearly"
- "Remember when you smoked pot last month? You're in no position to judge"

**What's Really Happening:**
Your occasional or past use is being stored as a weapon. Meanwhile, their behavior—potentially far more problematic—is positioned as irrelevant because you "also" use substances. This creates false equivalence that silences your concerns.

**The double standard:** Their drinking is "social" while yours is "a problem." Their use is "recreational" while yours indicates "poor judgment."

**How It Hooks You:**
You stop bringing up concerns because you feel like a hypocrite. You doubt your perceptions because "you'd been drinking." You become hyper-careful about your own consumption to avoid giving them ammunition.

**Your Power Move:**
"Having a drink doesn't erase what I witnessed or experienced. My perception is valid."

Separate conversations about their behavior from conversations about yours—they're not the same discussion.

> *"They're not concerned about your drinking. They're concerned about having something to use against you."*

## Using These Cards

### If You Recognize These Patterns

1. **You're not imagining things.** Substance-related manipulation is real and common.
2. **Your sober perception is valid.** Even if you'd been drinking when something happened, your memory and experience matter.
3. **Patterns matter more than incidents.** One drunken argument might be circumstance; consistent manipulation while drinking is a pattern.

### Protective Practices

- **Make important decisions sober.** Any agreement extracted while impaired can be revisited.
- **Notice the timing.** If serious conversations always happen when you've been drinking, that's data.
- **Trust your body.** If you feel pressured to drink more, that's a signal worth heeding.

### When to Seek Support

If substance use (yours or theirs) is significantly impacting your relationship or wellbeing:

- **Al-Anon**: 1-888-4AL-ANON (for families/friends of alcoholics)
- **SAMHSA National Helpline**: 1-800-662-4357
- **AA**: aa.org
