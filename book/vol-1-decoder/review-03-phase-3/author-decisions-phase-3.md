## Lydia's Line Editor Questions (18 Questions)

*Author responses provided via GitHub Issue #233 comment on January 5, 2026*

### Category A: Voice & Consistency

**Q1: Intentional "we" usage**
- [x] A) Keep "we" shifts as intentional solidarity moments
- [ ] B) Standardize to "you" throughout
- [ ] C) Review case-by-case and decide
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

**Reasoning:** The "we" shifts serve as intentional moments of solidarity with the reader, reinforcing that they are not alone in this work. These shifts create connection while maintaining the primary second-person address.

---

**Q2: Field Notes voice shift**
- [ ] A) Keep third person in Field Notes (intentional distance)
- [x] B) Convert to second person for consistency
- [ ] C) Keep third person but add framing note
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

**Reasoning:** Converting Field Notes to second person maintains voice consistency throughout the manuscript and keeps the intimate connection with the reader unbroken.

---

**Q3: Clinical vs. conversational tone**
- [x] A) Variation is intentional — clinical for science, conversational for support
- [ ] B) Lean more clinical throughout
- [ ] C) Lean more conversational throughout
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

**Reasoning:** The tonal variation serves the content—clinical language grounds the scientific explanations while conversational tone provides warmth during supportive sections. This rhythm is intentional and effective.

---

### Category B: Rhythm & Structure

**Q4: Rhythm variation in lists**
- [ ] A) Keep current density (reference format)
- [ ] B) Add subsection breaks for longer cards
- [x] C) Review longest cards individually
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

**Reasoning:** A case-by-case review allows for targeted improvements to the longest cards without disrupting the effective density of others that work well as reference material.

---

**Q5: Pause Points effectiveness**
- [ ] A) Yes, add Pause Points to Chapter 3 and other dense chapters
- [ ] B) Chapter 3 pause points already planned (Phase 2 decision)
- [x] C) Current distribution is sufficient
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

**Reasoning:** The current pause point distribution effectively balances the dense material. Additional pause points are not needed at this time.

---

### Category C: Word Choice

**Q6: "Here's" as transition**
- [ ] A) Intentional voice marker — keep as-is
- [ ] B) Reduce frequency, vary transitions
- [x] C) Review and vary only where repetitive
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

**Reasoning:** "Here's" is an effective voice marker, but reviewing for repetitive instances allows for natural variation where it would improve flow without losing the conversational tone.

---

**Q7: Contraction consistency**
- [x] A) Intentional pattern — contractions conversational, full forms clinical
- [ ] B) Standardize to contractions throughout
- [ ] C) Standardize to full forms throughout
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

**Reasoning:** The distinction between contractions (conversational sections) and full forms (clinical sections) is intentional and reinforces the tonal variation strategy.

---

**Q8: Em-dash frequency**
- [ ] A) Current frequency is intentional
- [x] B) Reduce to 1-2 per page (50% reduction per Phase 1)
- [ ] C) Reduce further

**Reasoning:** Honoring the Phase 1 decision to reduce em-dash frequency by 50% will improve readability while maintaining the conversational rhythm.

---

### Category D: Metaphor & Imagery

**Q9: Extended metaphors**
- [x] A) Intentional — core metaphors extended, others quick illustrations
- [ ] B) Extend more metaphors for consistency
- [ ] C) Reduce extended metaphors
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

**Reasoning:** Core metaphors like "The Gradual Dimming" receive extended development as teaching tools, while other metaphors serve as quick illustrations. This variation is purposeful.

---

**Q10: Frequency/energy language**
- [ ] A) Intentional — resonates with target audience
- [ ] B) Reduce spiritual/energy language
- [x] C) Add brief grounding note for skeptical readers
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

- [ ] A) "Welcome home" is the intentional ending
- [ ] B) Add brief forward-looking paragraph

---

**Q12: "Pause after Part X" chapters**
- [ ] A) Yes, integrate into chapter endings (per Phase 1 decision)
- [ ] B) Keep as separate interlude chapters
- [x] C) Remove from manuscript

**Reasoning:** The "Pause after Part X" chapters should be removed from the manuscript. The current chapter structure provides sufficient pacing without separate interlude files.

- [x] B) Add options where currently single response

**Reasoning:** Pull quotes should prioritize the most quotable and shareable phrases, maximizing their impact for readers who may share excerpts and for visual emphasis within the text.

---

**Q16: Field Notes as teaching tool**
- [ ] A) Case studies — showing patterns in action
- [ ] B) Emotional anchors — grounding abstract concepts
- [ ] C) Pattern illustrations — varied examples
- [x] D) All of the above, depending on chapter
- [ ] E) Other: _____________

---

### Category H: Patterns

**Q17: "You may have" softening**
- [ ] A) Intentional validation pattern — keep as-is
