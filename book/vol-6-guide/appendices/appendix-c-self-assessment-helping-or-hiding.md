# Appendix C: Self-Assessment: Am I Helping or Hiding?

## Understanding the Shadow Side of the Helper

---

The impulse to help is beautiful. It emerges from empathy, from care, from the genuine desire to ease suffering.

But for those who grew up in difficult homes, helping can become something else entirely.

It can become a way to:
- Earn love that should have been free
- Feel worthy through usefulness
- Avoid your own unmet needs
- Stay in control of relational dynamics
- Distract from your own pain
- Create a role that feels safe

This appendix helps you discern: Are you helping from overflow? Or hiding behind service?

---

## Why This Matters

If helping is hiding, you will:
- Burn out
- Resent those you help
- Need their healing more than they do
- Lose yourself in others' problems
- Attract clients who reinforce the pattern
- Be unable to stop even when depleted
- Never fill the hole you're trying to fill

*Hiding behind helping isn't service. It's survival. And survival strategies have costs.*

## Part I: The Self-Assessment

Answer honestly. No one sees this but you.

---

## Part II: Understanding Your Results

### If You Checked Many Items...

This isn't failure. This is awareness.

Most people drawn to helping work have some degree of shadow motivation. That doesn't make you bad—it makes you human. It makes you someone who learned to cope through usefulness.

*What matters now is what you do with this awareness.*

---

### The Spectrum of Helping

**Healthy Helping (Overflow)**
- Comes from fullness, not emptiness
- Has clear boundaries
- Isn't attached to outcomes
- Can be paused without crisis
- Doesn't require sacrifice of self
- Allows others to refuse help
- Celebrates their independence
- Fills you rather than depletes you

**Wounded Helping (Hiding)**
- Comes from unmet needs
- Boundaries are porous or absent
- Needs their improvement to feel okay
- Cannot stop even when depleted
- Requires self-sacrifice
- Creates dependency
- Feels threatening when they don't need you
- Depletes you but feels impossible to stop

**Most helpers are somewhere in between.** The goal isn't perfection—it's awareness and gradual movement toward health.

---

### What "Helping From Hiding" Looks Like

When helping is hiding, it:
- Feels compulsive, not chosen
- Creates resentment beneath the surface
- Leaves you depleted but unable to stop
- Avoids your own healing
- Requires their response to feel worthwhile
- Serves your needs disguised as serving theirs
- Recreates childhood dynamics
- Keeps you small behind usefulness

**The core question:** *Am I helping because they need it, or because I need to help?*

---

### What "Helping From Overflow" Looks Like

When helping is genuine service, it:
- Comes from fullness, not emptiness
- Feels sustainable and nourishing
- Has clear limits you can hold
- Doesn't require their outcome
- Leaves them with more agency
- Exists alongside robust self-care
- Can be paused without crisis
- Is one of many sources of identity

**The shift:** *From "I help to feel okay" to "I feel okay, and from that place, I can help."*

---

## Part III: The Repair Work

If you've recognized yourself in the shadow helper patterns, here's what to do:

### Step 1: Compassion, Not Shame

You learned to help as survival. That adaptation kept you safe. The child who learned to be useful was intelligent and resourceful.

*The problem isn't that you help. The problem is that helping became the only way to feel worthy.*

Shame won't heal this. Compassion will.

---

### Step 2: Examine Your Origins

Revisit Section A. Where did this pattern start? What were you trying to earn? What were you trying to avoid?

**Journaling prompts:**
- What did I learn about my value as a child?
- When did I first become the helper?
- What happened when I had needs?
- What was the unspoken rule about who got to be taken care of?

---

### Step 3: Notice the Pattern in Real Time

Use the body signals from Section D. When you're about to over-give, notice:
- The urgency to fix
- The inability to tolerate their discomfort
- The compulsion to offer more
- The guilt when you set limits
- The resentment beneath the helping

Name it: "This is the pattern." Naming creates space.

---

### Step 4: Practice Receiving

You cannot help sustainably if you cannot receive.

**Practices:**
- Let someone else help you (without reciprocating immediately)
- Receive a compliment without deflecting
- Ask for what you need (and let them give it)
- Accept care without earning it
- Sit with being on the receiving end

**Journaling prompt:** What comes up when you receive without giving?

---

### Step 5: Practice Not Helping

This might be the hardest practice.

**Try:**
- Let someone struggle without intervening
- Let them solve their own problem
- Hold space without offering solutions
- Be present without being useful
- Spend a day doing nothing productive

**Notice:** What arises when you're not helping? Anxiety? Emptiness? Guilt? That's the wound beneath the helping.

---

### Step 6: Develop Identity Beyond Helping

You are more than your usefulness.

**Practices:**
- Invest in relationships where helping isn't the currency
- Develop interests that aren't about service
- Spend time with people who don't need you
- Ask yourself: Who am I when I'm not helping?
- Let yourself be boring, ordinary, unexceptional

---

### Step 7: Get Your Own Help

Shadow helper patterns require therapeutic work. You cannot fully see this alone.

- Work with a therapist who understands these dynamics
- Engage in regular supervision that explores your shadow
- Join peer consultation groups
- Do your own healing work—not just learning about healing

---

### Step 8: Redefine Service

Healthy helping is still possible. But it requires a new definition:

**Old definition:** Service means sacrifice. I help so I have value.

**New definition:** Service means overflow. I fill myself first, and from that fullness, I offer.

*The most sustainable helpers are the ones who have done their own work.*

---

## Part IV: Ongoing Self-Monitoring

Use these check-ins regularly:

### Weekly Check-In

| Question | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Did I over-give this week? Where? | |
| Did I have difficulty holding boundaries? | |
| Did I receive care or help from anyone? | |
| How is my body feeling? | |
| Am I depleted or filled by my helping work? | |

### Monthly Reflection

| Question | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Which shadow helper pattern was most active? | |
| What triggered the over-giving? | |
| What am I avoiding by helping? | |
| What needs of mine are going unmet? | |
| What do I need to bring to supervision or therapy? | |

### Quarterly Review

| Question | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Overall, am I helping from hiding or from overflow? | |
| What has changed since I started this awareness practice? | |
| Where am I still stuck? | |
| What's one thing I can change this quarter? | |

---

## Part V: Anchor Phrases

Carry these with you:

**When you're about to over-give:**
*"Their struggle is not mine to fix. I can witness without rescuing."*

**When you feel guilty for having boundaries:**
*"Limits are loving. My sustainability is my service."*

**When you're depleted but want to keep going:**
*"I cannot pour from an empty cup. Refilling is not selfish."*

**When you don't know who you are without helping:**
*"I am more than my usefulness. I exist beyond what I give."*

**When you're afraid to receive:**
*"Receiving is a skill I'm learning. I don't have to earn care."*

---

## The Summary

### If you recognize yourself in these patterns:

1. You are not broken. You adapted.
2. Helping became survival—it's not your fault.
3. Awareness is the first step toward change.
4. This pattern can shift with consistent work.
5. Sustainable helping is still possible.

### The transformation:

**From:** "I help to earn love."
**To:** "I am loved, and from that love, I help."

**From:** "My worth is my usefulness."
**To:** "My worth exists regardless of what I give."

**From:** "I can't stop helping, even when depleted."
**To:** "I fill myself first. I help from overflow."

---

*"I was not born to be useful. I was born to be whole. From wholeness, I can serve."*
