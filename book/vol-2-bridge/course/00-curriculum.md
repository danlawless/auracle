# Course 2: The Bridge

## Learning Secure Attachment After Trauma

---

## Course Overview

**Stage:** HEAL
**Duration:** ~12 hours
**Lessons:** 28 video lessons across 6 modules
**Core Insight:** *"Leaving hurts because your body learned danger as connection."*

This course teaches you to retrain your nervous system for secure attachment. You've recognized the patterns—now we heal them. By the end, you'll understand why insight alone isn't enough and have practiced the somatic skills that create real change.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this course, you will:

1. **Understand** — Why insight alone doesn't heal and what does
2. **Recognize** — How childhood roles shape adult attraction
3. **Retrain** — Your nervous system to tolerate safety
4. **Practice** — Secure attachment through regulation and reparenting
5. **Choose** — Relationships that regulate rather than activate
6. **Trust** — Yourself without needing external validation

---

## Prerequisites

This course builds on Course 1: The Narcissism Decoder. You should have:
- Basic understanding of manipulation patterns
- Familiarity with trauma bonds
- Awareness of the 3-3-3 Rule and body-based recognition

If you haven't completed Course 1, we recommend starting there.

## What's Next

After completing Course 2, you are ready for:

**Course 3: Sovereignty** — Install internal authority. Own your emotional field. Lead from presence rather than performance.

---

## The Core Principle

*Secure attachment is not found—it is practiced.*

Your nervous system learned safety through vigilance, anticipation, intensity, compliance, and caretaking.

Healing requires new experiences of safety, not more understanding.

This course provides those experiences.

---

*"I stopped asking who could make me feel safe—and learned how to be safe with myself."*
