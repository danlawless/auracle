## Key Observations

### What's Working Exceptionally Well

1. **"What it feels like in your body" sections** — signature feature, consistently executed
2. **Pull quotes in italics** — effective visual and conceptual breaks
3. **"This isn't X. It's Y." contrast pattern** — powerful teaching tool
4. **Decoder card structure** — highly consistent, scannable format
5. **Field Notes** — intimate, specific, impactful (when voice stays consistent)
6. **Power Move sections** — empowering and practical
7. **Question-then-answer structure** — engages reader naturally
8. **Body-based metaphors** — vivid and specific ("chest cave," "throat lock," "gut churn")
9. **Tactical protocols** — concrete, actionable, grounding
10. **Triple structure repetition** — rhythmically effective

### Patterns for Potential Refinement

These are strong patterns that could be varied slightly for even more impact:

1. **"Here's" as transition** (~15 instances) — intentional voice marker or vary?
2. **"You may have"** (~20 instances) — gentle validation or add variety?
3. **Em-dashes** (2-3 per page) — intentional conversational tone or reduce?
4. **Occasional "we" intrusions** — solidarity moments or prefer pure "you"?
5. **Field Notes voice shift** (Ch 10) — intentional distance or convert to second person?

### Micro-Patterns Observed

- **Contractions**: Mix of "isn't/doesn't" and "is not/does not"
- **List parallelism**: Generally strong, minor variations in verb form
- **Metaphor development**: Some extended, others quick (appears intentional)
- **Scripts/dialogue**: Authentic and usable throughout
