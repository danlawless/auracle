### Script

These are the tactics that attack what you know is true.

If you've ever walked away from a conversation wondering if you imagined what just happened—if you've questioned your own memory, your perception, your sanity—you've experienced information and perception tactics.

These form the foundation of manipulation because they compromise your reality testing. Once you can't trust your own perception, you become dependent on someone else to tell you what's real.

Let's decode the major tactics in this category.

**Tactic 1: Gaslighting**

This is the most recognized term, but it's often misunderstood.

Gaslighting is the systematic denial of your reality to make you doubt your own perception.

It's not just disagreement. It's not just having a different perspective. It's the flat denial that something happened, was said, or meant what it clearly meant.

"I never said that."
"That's not what happened."
"You're imagining things."
"You're so paranoid."

Gaslighting works because most of us extend good faith. We assume we might be wrong. We're willing to question ourselves.

The manipulator exploits that willingness. They don't just deny the event—they often add that you're crazy for thinking it happened. Now you're not just confused about the event; you're questioning your mental stability.

**The decoder:** If you consistently remember things differently than someone else, and that difference always serves their narrative—that's a pattern. Trust your memory.

**Tactic 2: Reality Revision**

This is gaslighting's close cousin. Instead of denying something happened, they rewrite what it meant.

"I was just joking."
"You took that the wrong way."
"I was trying to help you."
"You're being too sensitive."

Notice what's happening: The event isn't denied, but your interpretation is replaced with theirs. The meaning is revised.

Over time, you stop trusting your interpretations. You defer to their version of reality.

**The decoder:** Pay attention to the gap between impact and intent. If their actions consistently hurt you, their claimed intent becomes irrelevant. Impact is measurable. Intent is just their narrative.

**Tactic 3: Selective Memory**

They have perfect recall for anything you did wrong, and complete amnesia for anything they did wrong.

"I don't remember saying that."
"You're bringing up the past."
"We've already discussed this—let it go."

But somehow they remember every mistake you made five years ago, and they bring it up regularly.

**The decoder:** Note the asymmetry. If their memory failures always favor them, that's not forgetfulness. That's strategy.

**Tactic 4: Information Withholding**

They control what you know.

They "forget" to mention things. They share information selectively. They tell different people different things.

You find out about plans at the last minute. You learn about decisions after they're made. You're always slightly behind.

This keeps you off-balance and ensures you can't plan independently.

**The decoder:** Notice the pattern of how information flows. If you're consistently the last to know, or if information seems to route through one person, that's a control structure.

**Tactic 5: Contradiction Flooding**

They say contradictory things in close succession, leaving you unable to pin down what they actually think or want.

"I want you to be more independent—but you never spend time with me."
"You need to speak up more—but don't argue with me."
"I wish you'd make decisions—but why didn't you check with me first?"

You can't win because the rules constantly change. Every direction has a trap.

**The decoder:** When you realize every choice leads to criticism, stop trying to find the right choice. The contradiction is the point.

**Tactic 6: Moving the Goalposts**

You meet their stated expectation, and suddenly the expectation changes.

You thought if you just did X, things would be better. So you did X. Now they need Y. You accomplish Y. Now it's about Z.

The target is always moving, so you can never succeed.

**The decoder:** Track the pattern. If your efforts never result in lasting satisfaction, the goal was never satisfaction. The goal was keeping you trying.

**Tactic 7: Comparative Reality**

"Nobody else has a problem with me."
"Everyone agrees with me."
"All my friends think you're overreacting."

They invoke an invisible jury that always agrees with them. This makes you feel like the problem is specifically with you.

**The decoder:** You have no access to what "everyone" actually thinks. And even if everyone did agree with them, that doesn't make your experience wrong. Your perception belongs to you.

**Tactic 8: Plausible Deniability**

Everything they do has an alternative explanation.

The put-down was "just a joke." The forgetting was "an accident." The hurtful comment was "not what they meant."

Any single incident sounds reasonable when explained. It's only when you see the pattern that the damage becomes clear.

But if you bring up the pattern, you're "building a case against them" or "keeping score."

**The decoder:** When someone consistently needs to explain away their impact, the explanations become the pattern. Trust the pattern, not the explanations.

**Why these tactics matter most**

Information and perception tactics are foundational because they compromise your reality testing.

Once you don't trust your own perception:
- You can't accurately assess danger
- You can't build a case for yourself
- You can't trust your memories
- You become dependent on their version of reality

This is why gaslighting is so damaging. It doesn't just hurt you in the moment—it undermines your ability to know what's true going forward.

**Recovery from perception tactics**

If you've experienced significant perception manipulation, you may need to rebuild trust in yourself. Here's a starting point:

Write things down. Keep a journal of what happened, what was said, how you felt. When they tell you it didn't happen, you have a record.

Trust patterns over incidents. One thing could be a misunderstanding. A pattern is data.

Seek external reality checks. Ask trusted people who have no stake in the relationship: "Does this sound normal to you?"

Honor your body's response. Even if your mind is confused, your body knows. That knot in your stomach is real.

**In our next lesson,** we'll cover Emotional and Relational Tactics—the hijacking of your feelings and your connection needs.

For now, if any of these tactics resonated: that sick feeling of recognition is valid. You weren't crazy. You were being systematically confused.

|--------|--------|------------------|
| Gaslighting | /5 | |
| Reality Revision | /5 | |
| Selective Memory | /5 | |
| Information Withholding | /5 | |
| Contradiction Flooding | /5 | |
| Moving Goalposts | /5 | |
| Comparative Reality | /5 | |
| Plausible Deniability | /5 | |

**Reflection Questions:**
1. Which tactic affected you most?
2. How did this impact your ability to trust yourself?
3. What would it mean to reclaim your perception?

## Notes for AI Narrator

- Tone: Clear, validating, slightly revelatory
- Pace: Measured; each tactic needs to land
- Energy: Building recognition—"yes, that happened to me"
- Note: The "decoder" sections should feel like insights, not lectures
