# GitHub Issue: Morgan (Managing Editor) - Phase 1 Priority & Coordination

**Title:** `[Review Round 4 - Phase 1] Morgan (Managing Editor): 15 Coordination Questions - Vol. 1`

**Labels:** `review-round-4`, `phase-1-strategic`, `author-input-required`, `vol-1-decoder`

**Repository:** danlawless/auracle

## Overview

Hi! I'm Morgan, the Managing Editor (The Conductor). This is Phase 1 of Review Round 4 for Volume 1: The Narcissism Decoder.

**My Role:** I coordinate priorities, track progress, identify conflicts, and ensure all editorial streams align. Diana addresses WHAT to change; I address WHICH changes to prioritize, WHEN, and HOW they interact.

**Why These Questions Matter:** Editorial decisions cascade. A timeline choice affects resource allocation. A scope decision affects editor depth. These 15 questions establish the parameters that make all other Round 4 work possible.

---

## How to Respond

For each question, please provide your decision and brief reasoning. Your answers will determine:
1. Edition planning (current vs. future)
2. Priority sequencing
3. Resource allocation
4. Timeline to completion

## Current Status: Post-Round 3 Assessment

**Accomplishments from Round 3:**
- 5-part structure finalized
- Chapter 10 repositioned (childhood patterns)
- Chapter 3 split (playbook breathing room)
- Crisis reading paths enhanced
- Content warnings placed
- Cross-references updated
- Proofreading to near-publication quality

**Outstanding from Round 3:**
- Issue #243 (Petra's 3 corrections + 5 questions) — integration document created
- Author decisions on style consistency questions

---

## Section A: Edition Planning (Q1-Q4)

### Q1: Current Edition Status

**The Question:** What is the status of the current manuscript?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Publication-ready after Issue #243 resolution
- [ ] B) Needs this Round 4 review before publication
- [ ] C) Publication imminent — Round 4 is for future edition
- [ ] D) Already published — Round 4 informs next edition

**Editor Comments:**
*I'm asking this to establish whether Round 4 findings should be implemented immediately or documented for future revisions. This fundamentally affects how we approach every subsequent question. If the manuscript is publication-ready, Round 4 becomes enhancement documentation. If publication depends on Round 4, we need different urgency levels.*

### Q2: Round 4 Scope Definition

**The Question:** What is the intended scope of Round 4?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Quality assurance — verify Round 3 implementations
- [ ] B) Enhancement identification — note improvements for future
- [ ] C) Comprehensive re-review — fresh eyes on everything
- [ ] D) Focused review — specific areas only (specify): _____________

**Editor Comments:**
*Scope definition prevents scope creep. Round 3 was substantial—I want to ensure Round 4 doesn't inadvertently restart debates already resolved. Option A (QA) would be fastest. Option C (comprehensive) would be most thorough but could delay publication. This choice affects how I brief other editors.*

### Q3: Future Edition Planning

**The Question:** Are you planning a revised/expanded edition?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Yes, within 6 months
- [ ] B) Yes, within 1-2 years
- [ ] C) Possibly, based on reader feedback
- [ ] D) No plans currently
- [ ] E) Depends on sales/reception

**Editor Comments:**
*Knowing your future edition timeline helps me categorize Round 4 findings. Some suggestions (like structural experiments) make sense only if a revised edition is planned. If "no plans currently," we can still document ideas but won't spend time developing detailed implementation specs. This also affects how we handle Diana's Q16-Q20 (future edition questions).*

### Q4: Round 4 Priority Level

**The Question:** How should Round 4 findings be prioritized?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Critical — implement before next print run
- [ ] B) High — implement for next edition
- [ ] C) Medium — consider for future revisions
- [ ] D) Low — document for reference only

**Editor Comments:**
*Priority level determines how detailed our implementation recommendations need to be. "Critical" means specific instructions and quality verification. "Low" means high-level notes only. This also affects how much author time I should expect Round 4 to require.*

## Section B: Implementation Verification (Q5-Q8)

### Q5: Issue #243 Resolution Status

**Context:** Petra's proofreading review identified 3 direct corrections and 5 author questions.

**The Question:** What is the resolution status?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) All corrections applied, all questions answered
- [ ] B) Corrections applied, questions pending
- [ ] C) Both pending
- [ ] D) Partially complete (specify): _____________

**Editor Comments:**
*Issue #243 represents the final loose thread from Round 3. Before launching Round 4 properly, I need to confirm Round 3 is truly complete. Unresolved items create confusing editorial history. If questions are pending, I can integrate them into Round 4 rather than having two parallel tracks.*

### Q6: Round 3 Cross-Reference Audit

**Context:** Major chapter renumbering occurred in Round 3.

**The Question:** Have all cross-references been systematically verified?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Yes — comprehensive audit completed
- [ ] B) Partially — spot checks done
- [ ] C) Not yet — needs full audit
- [ ] D) Unknown — needs verification

**Editor Comments:**
*Chapter renumbering is high-risk for orphaned references. "Chapter 18" became "Chapter 10"—any internal references to "see Chapter 18" are now broken. If audit hasn't been done, this becomes a Phase 4 (Petra) critical task. I'm flagging this now because broken references affect reader trust.*

### Q7: Content Warning Verification

**Context:** Content warnings were added for sensitive sections.

**The Question:** Are all content warnings in place and appropriately positioned?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Yes — all verified
- [ ] B) Mostly — minor gaps possible
- [ ] C) Needs review
- [ ] D) Unknown — needs verification

**Editor Comments:**
*Content warnings are both ethical responsibility and reader safety. Given the sensitive nature of narcissistic abuse content, missing warnings could cause reader harm. Round 3 added warnings; Round 4 should verify placement, especially before triggering content (suicide threats, physical intimidation, sexual manipulation tactics).*

### Q8: Resource Currency

**Context:** Crisis hotlines and resources must be current.

**The Question:** When were resources last verified?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Verified within last 30 days
- [ ] B) Verified within last 90 days
- [ ] C) Verified during Round 3 (date: _______)
- [ ] D) Needs re-verification

**Editor Comments:**
*Crisis resources change. The 988 Suicide Prevention Lifeline replaced 1-800-273-TALK in July 2022. I want to establish a verification protocol. For this volume specifically: NDVH (1-800-799-7233), 988, Crisis Text Line (741741) should all be verified as active before publication. Outdated resources could leave readers without help when they need it most.*

## Section C: Workflow Coordination (Q9-Q12)

### Q9: Review Phase Sequencing

**The Question:** Should Round 4 phases proceed sequentially or can some run in parallel?

**Recommended Sequencing:**
- Phase 1 (Diana + Morgan): Must complete first
- Phase 2 (Bailey + Sage + Felix): Can run in parallel
- Phase 3 (Lydia + Clara): Sequential after Phase 2
- Phase 4 (Petra + Analysis): Last

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Follow recommended sequencing
- [ ] B) Modified sequencing (specify): _____________
- [ ] C) All phases can run in parallel
- [ ] D) Prioritize specific phases: _____________

**Editor Comments:**
*I recommend this sequencing because: Phase 1 (structural) decisions affect what Phase 2 (content) reviewers should focus on. Phase 3 (line/copy) should happen after content is stable. Phase 4 (proofing) must be last. However, if timeline is tight, Phase 2 reviewers can run in parallel with each other. Option C (full parallel) risks reviewers working at cross-purposes.*

### Q10: Editor Review Depth

**The Question:** How thorough should each editor's Round 4 review be?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Comprehensive — full manuscript review
- [ ] B) Targeted — focus on Round 3 implementation areas
- [ ] C) Spot-check — sample chapters only
- [ ] D) Varies by editor (specify): _____________

**Editor Comments:**
*This is about efficient use of editorial resources. Comprehensive reviews after Round 3's thorough work may produce diminishing returns. My recommendation: Diana (targeted on structural), Bailey (comprehensive on engagement), Sage (targeted on sensitivity), Lydia/Clara (spot-check unless issues found), Petra (comprehensive final). This balances thoroughness with efficiency.*

### Q11: Author Response Timeline

**The Question:** What's your target timeline for responding to Round 4 questions?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Within 1 week per phase
- [ ] B) Within 2 weeks per phase
- [ ] C) As time permits
- [ ] D) Batched response after all phases complete
- [ ] E) Other: _____________

**Editor Comments:**
*Knowing your response timeline helps me manage editor expectations and schedule dependencies. Option D (batched) is most flexible for you but creates longest overall timeline. Option A (1 week) keeps momentum but requires dedicated time. I recommend B (2 weeks) as a balance—enough time for thoughtful responses without losing project momentum.*

### Q12: Decision Documentation

**The Question:** How should Round 4 decisions be documented?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Author-decisions files in each phase folder (current approach)
- [ ] B) Single consolidated decisions document
- [ ] C) GitHub issue comments
- [ ] D) Combination approach

**Editor Comments:**
*Documentation method affects future reference usability. Option A (separate files) maintains organization but fragments history. Option B (consolidated) creates single source of truth. Option C (GitHub) integrates with existing issue workflow. Option D (combination) offers redundancy. For Vol 1, I recommend D: GitHub for discussion, author-decisions files for final record. This supports both in-moment collaboration and long-term reference.*

## Section D: Outstanding Items (Q13-Q15)

### Q13: Round 3 Deferred Items

**Context:** Some Round 3 items may have been deferred to Round 4 or future editions.

**The Question:** Are there specific deferred items to address in Round 4?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) No deferred items
- [ ] B) Yes — list attached: _____________
- [ ] C) Unknown — need to compile
- [ ] D) Deferred items are for future edition only

**Editor Comments:**
*Deferred items create editorial debt. If items were consciously postponed to Round 4, I need to know so they don't fall through the cracks. If Option C (unknown), I'll compile from Round 3 documentation and present for your review. Clear accounting prevents "I thought we were going to..." conversations later.*

### Q14: Known Issues Inventory

**The Question:** Are there any known issues not captured in previous rounds?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) No — all issues are documented
- [ ] B) Yes — new issues: _____________
- [ ] C) Possible — need review
- [ ] D) Will surface during Round 4 reviews

**Editor Comments:**
*This is your opportunity to surface anything nagging at you that hasn't made it into formal review documentation. Reader feedback? Personal observations? Areas where you've second-guessed Round 3 decisions? Better to surface now and address systematically than discover mid-publication.*

### Q15: Success Criteria for Round 4

**The Question:** What defines Round 4 success?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) All questions answered, decisions documented
- [ ] B) Critical items addressed, others logged for future
- [ ] C) Comprehensive review completed regardless of implementation
- [ ] D) Manuscript declared "edition complete"
- [ ] E) Other: _____________

**Editor Comments:**
*Success criteria help me know when Round 4 is "done." Option A (all answered) is process-complete. Option D (edition complete) is outcome-complete. Different criteria lead to different endpoint conversations. I recommend B for realistic closure: address what needs addressing now, document the rest well. This prevents perfectionism paralysis while maintaining quality.*
