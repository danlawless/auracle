## The 3-3-3 Rule

When you feel activated, use this:

| Step | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **3 Seconds** | Pause before responding | Break reactive patterns |
| **3 Breaths** | Inhale 4, exhale 6 | Engage parasympathetic system |
| **3 Words** | Keep responses minimal | Starve the manipulation |

**Sample responses:**
- "I'll think about that."
- "Interesting perspective."
- "Not for me."
- "I need time."

## The 72-Hour Test

Before any major decision about someone:

1. **Wait 72 hours** — Love-bombing neurochemistry needs time to settle
2. **Notice what shifts** — Patterns invisible in excitement become visible in calm
3. **Trust your settled self** — The version that emerges after intensity fades

---

## The Master Exposure Question

> *"When was the last time you were genuinely wrong, admitted it without being forced to, and changed your behavior as a result?"*

**Healthy response:** Specific, recent example with genuine reflection

**Narcissistic response:** Struggle, deflect, reverse, or produce an example where they were actually right all along

## Top 10 Manipulation Tactics

| Tactic | What It Sounds Like | What It's Doing |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Gaslighting** | "That never happened" | Making you doubt reality |
| **Love Bombing** | Intense early affection | Creating dependency through oxytocin |
| **Silent Treatment** | Withdrawal without explanation | Punishing through abandonment fear |
| **DARVO** | Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim/Offender | Flipping the script |
| **Future Faking** | "When we..." "Soon we'll..." | Creating hope to maintain control |
| **Triangulation** | Bringing in third parties | Creating insecurity and competition |
| **Intermittent Reinforcement** | Unpredictable kindness/cruelty | Most addictive reward schedule |
| **Word Salad** | Circular, confusing arguments | Exhausting you into submission |
| **Covert Contracts** | Unspoken expectations | Creating debt without consent |
| **Moving Goalposts** | Changing criteria for approval | Ensuring you never succeed |

## Body Signals of Manipulation

Your body often knows before your mind. Watch for:

**During interaction:**
- Stomach tightening
- Shallow breathing
- Urge to over-explain
- Feeling small or apologetic
- Brain fog or confusion

**After interaction:**
- Exhaustion
- Second-guessing yourself
- Rehearsing conversations
- Feeling "off" without knowing why
- Relief when they're gone

## The Trauma Bond Cycle

```
1. TENSION BUILDING
   ↓
2. INCIDENT (abuse/manipulation)
   ↓
3. RECONCILIATION (apologies, love bombing)
   ↓
4. CALM/HONEYMOON PHASE
   ↓
   [cycle repeats]
```

**Why it's hard to leave:** Your nervous system is bonded to the relief, not to the person. Breaking the bond requires understanding this biology.

## Key Distinctions

| What They Say | What It Actually Means |
|---------------|------------------------|
| "You're too sensitive" | "Stop having inconvenient reactions" |
| "I was just joking" | "I want to hurt you without consequences" |
| "You made me do this" | "I won't take responsibility" |
| "No one else would put up with you" | "I'm isolating you" |
| "After all I've done for you" | "I'm keeping score to control you" |
| "I'm sorry you feel that way" | "I'm not actually sorry" |
| "You're overreacting" | "Your valid response is inconvenient" |
| "That's not what I said" | "I'm rewriting history" |

---

## Responding vs. Reacting

| Reaction (Survival) | Response (Sovereignty) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Defending yourself | Naming behavior quietly |
| Over-explaining | "I don't need to explain this" |
| Getting pulled into debate | "I've said what I needed to" |
| Apologizing for boundaries | Standing silently in your no |
| Trying to make them understand | Accepting they won't |

## The Gray Rock Method

When you must interact but want to minimize engagement:

1. **Be boring** — Offer minimal emotional response
2. **Be brief** — Short answers, no elaboration
3. **Be unremarkable** — Give nothing to hook onto
4. **Be consistent** — Don't vary your approach

**Example exchanges:**
- "How was your day?" → "Fine."
- "What did you do?" → "Not much."
- "Why won't you talk to me?" → "I am talking."

---

## Emergency Grounding

When activated, try this 5-4-3-2-1 technique:

- **5** things you can SEE
- **4** things you can TOUCH
- **3** things you can HEAR
- **2** things you can SMELL
- **1** thing you can TASTE

This brings you back to the present moment and out of emotional hijack.

## Red Flags Checklist

Early warning signs to watch for:

- [ ] Excessive charm or intensity early on
- [ ] Moving relationship forward too quickly
- [ ] Bad-mouthing all exes as "crazy"
- [ ] Victim narrative in every situation
- [ ] Boundary testing disguised as jokes

- [ ] You feel like you're always the problem
- [ ] Walking on eggshells

## What You're Learning

1. **Naming creates power** — When you can name what's happening, it stops happening *to* you and starts happening *in front of* you

2. **Your body was right** — Those "gut feelings" were real signals

3. **This wasn't your fault** — You were adapting to survive, not choosing dysfunction

4. **Confusion was the strategy** — Feeling crazy was the intended effect

5. **You can trust yourself again** — Your perception is reliable
