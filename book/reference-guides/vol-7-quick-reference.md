# The Return
## Quick Reference Guide

**Volume 7: Money, Work & Building a Life After Survival Mode**

---

## Core Truth

> *"You are allowed to thrive, not just survive."*

---

## Survival Mode Is Not a Life Plan

| Survival Mode | Thriving |
|---------------|----------|
| "Just get through today" | "I'm building something" |
| Scarcity decisions | Abundance decisions |
| Reactive | Intentional |
| Minimizing needs | Honoring needs |
| "I don't deserve more" | "I am allowed more" |

**You've survived. Now you're allowed to live.**

---

## Understanding Financial Abuse

Financial abuse includes:

| Tactic | What It Looks Like |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Control** | Allowances, permission needed for spending |
| **Sabotage** | Ruining your career, credit, employment |
| **Exploitation** | Using your earnings, running up debt in your name |
| **Deprivation** | Withholding resources you need |
| **Information hiding** | Keeping you ignorant of finances |
| **Economic threats** | "You'll have nothing without me" |

**Financial abuse is abuse. The effects are real.**

---

## The Scarcity Nervous System

After financial abuse/instability, your body may believe:

| What Your Body Believes | What's Actually True |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| "There's never enough" | You can build security |
| "It could disappear anytime" | You can create stability |
| "I don't deserve this" | You're allowed prosperity |
| "Spending is dangerous" | Conscious spending is safe |
| "Save everything, enjoy nothing" | Balance is possible |

**Financial recovery is nervous system work.**

---

## Rebuilding From Zero: First Steps

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Safety first** — Basic needs secured |
| 2 | **Document** — Know what you have/owe |
| 3 | **Small wins** — Build evidence you can manage money |
| 4 | **Separate accounts** — Money only you control |
| 5 | **Emergency fund** — Even $100 starts |
| 6 | **Income** — Any income is a start |
| 7 | **Credit** — Begin rebuilding if damaged |

**Progress > Perfection**

---

## Money Stories Inventory

What did you learn about money growing up?

| Common Messages | Where It Came From | Truth |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| "We can't afford that" | Scarcity household | You can earn and choose |
| "Money is dirty/evil" | Shame-based environment | Money is neutral—a tool |
| "Rich people are bad" | Class-based beliefs | Prosperity doesn't make you bad |
| "You'll never be good with money" | Undermining authority | You can learn anything |
| "Don't ask for what you need" | Deprivation training | Your needs are legitimate |

**Identify the story. Question the story. Rewrite the story.**

---

## Financial Sovereignty

| Dependency | Sovereignty |
|------------|-------------|
| "I need them for money" | "I can create my own security" |
| "I have to ask permission" | "I decide how I spend/save" |
| "I don't understand money" | "I'm learning and growing" |
| "Money controls me" | "I manage money consciously" |
| "I can't handle this" | "I'm building capacity" |

---

## Professional Identity After Trauma

If trauma interrupted your career:

| Loss | Recovery Path |
|------|---------------|
| **Skills atrophied** | Identify what's still there, rebuild what's needed |
| **Confidence gone** | Start small, build evidence |
| **Resume gaps** | You have a story—tell it strategically |
| **Identity erased** | Discover who you are NOW |
| **Dreams abandoned** | Dreams can resurrect or transform |

**You're not starting over. You're building forward.**

---

## Career Gaps: The Story You Tell

You don't owe anyone your trauma story. Options:

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Vague but true** | "I was dealing with a family matter" |
| **Focused on growth** | "I took time to reset priorities" |
| **Skills-focused** | "During that time I developed [X]" |
| **Redirect** | "What I can offer now is..." |

**You control your narrative. Full disclosure is not required.**

---

## Workplace Boundaries

| Situation | Boundary Script |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Overtime pressure** | "I'm not available after [time]" |
| **Scope creep** | "Let's clarify what's in my role" |
| **Toxic meetings** | "I need to step out. I'll follow up later." |
| **Personal questions** | "I prefer to keep that private" |
| **Credit stealing** | "I worked on that project. Let me share what I contributed." |

---

## Signs of Workplace Narcissism

Watch for:
- Credit-taking / blame-shifting
- Moving goalposts on expectations
- Public humiliation disguised as feedback
- Favoritism and triangulation
- Gaslighting about agreements
- Undermining your competence
- Taking your ideas as their own

**Trust your pattern recognition. It applies at work too.**

---

## Purpose After Survival

| Survival Mode | Purpose Mode |
|---------------|--------------|
| "I'll do anything to get by" | "I want work that matters" |
| "I can't afford to choose" | "I'm building toward choice" |
| "Purpose is luxury" | "Purpose is sustainable" |
| "Work is suffering" | "Work can be aligned" |

**You're allowed to want more than survival from your work.**

---

## Building a Business From Sovereignty

| From Scarcity | From Sovereignty |
|---------------|------------------|
| "I'll take any client" | "I choose who I work with" |
| "I have to hustle constantly" | "I build sustainable systems" |
| "I can't charge that much" | "My value determines my price" |
| "Competition is threat" | "There's room for everyone" |
| "Success means I have to suffer" | "Success can feel good" |

---

## Pricing and Receiving

| Undercharging Says | Sovereign Pricing Says |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| "I'm not worth it" | "This is my value" |
| "They can't afford it" | "Let them decide" |
| "Money is dirty" | "Money is exchange" |
| "I should give it away" | "I can give AND receive" |

**Practice:** Can you receive a compliment without deflecting? Start there.

---

## Wealth Without Guilt

| Guilt Pattern | Reframe |
|---------------|---------|
| "I shouldn't have more than others" | "My prosperity doesn't cause their poverty" |
| "I didn't earn this" | "I can receive AND earn" |
| "Good people don't have money" | "Good people can be prosperous" |
| "I should give it all away" | "I can give from overflow" |
| "Thriving betrays my past" | "Thriving honors my survival" |

**Prosperity is not betrayal. It's fruit of healing.**

---

## Success Triggers

When good things happen, watch for:

| Trigger | What It's Touching |
|---------|-------------------|
| Self-sabotage | "I don't deserve this" |
| Waiting for the other shoe | "Good things don't last" |
| Imposter syndrome | "They'll find out I'm a fraud" |
| Discomfort with ease | "If it's not hard, it's not real" |
| Giving it away immediately | "I can't hold this for myself" |

**Success can activate old trauma. Notice it. Don't act on it.**

---

## Building a Life That Holds You

| Area | Question to Ask |
|------|-----------------|
| **Home** | Does this space support my nervous system? |
| **Work** | Does this work align with who I'm becoming? |
| **Relationships** | Do these people regulate or deplete me? |
| **Health** | Am I caring for the body that survived? |
| **Joy** | When did I last do something just for pleasure? |

**Your outer life is allowed to match your inner healing.**

---

## Daily Prosperity Anchors

> "I am allowed to thrive today. Prosperity is not betrayal."

**At work:**
> "I bring value. I receive value. This exchange is good."
