# Endorsement Strategy for "Control Disguised as Care"

## Why Endorsements Matter for Bestseller Status

Endorsements (blurbs) signal credibility, attract readers, and influence bookstore placement. For a book on narcissistic abuse, strategic endorsements can:
- Validate the content as clinically sound
- Connect with audiences who follow specific thought leaders
- Differentiate from the many books in this space
- Provide pull quotes for Amazon, back cover, and marketing

### Sample Outreach Email

```
Subject: Endorsement Request: "Control Disguised as Care" - Narcissistic Abuse Recovery Book

Dear [Name],

Your work on [specific work of theirs] has been foundational in helping survivors understand [specific topic]. I'm reaching out because I believe you would appreciate a new resource I've written for this community.

"Control Disguised as Care: The Narcissism Decoder" is a practical guide to recognizing and responding to manipulation patterns in real-time. As a trauma-trained therapist who spent years working on locked psychiatric units and in family therapy settings—while navigating these dynamics in my own life—I wrote the book I wished I'd had.

What makes this book unique:
- 56 named manipulation tactics organized into a "Decoder Playbook"
- 52 "Decoder Cards" for real-time pattern recognition
- Body-based recognition tools (helping readers trust their nervous system)
- A 4-step protocol that works even when activated

I would be honored if you would consider providing an endorsement. I've attached a one-page summary and can send the full manuscript at your request.

Publication is scheduled for [date], and I would need any endorsement by [deadline].

Thank you for considering this request, and more importantly, thank you for the work you do supporting survivors.

Warmly,
Jennifer Brooke Lawless
[Contact information]

- Include author photo and short bio

**Amazon book description:**
- Lead with strongest endorsement as social proof
- Include 1-2 more in description body

**Marketing materials:**
- Rotate endorsements based on audience
- Use different blurbs for different platforms

---

## If You Get a "No" or No Response

- Most outreach gets no response—this is normal
- A "no" is not personal; busy people decline often
- Never argue or follow up more than twice
- Thank anyone who responds, even to decline
- Some may offer to review but not endorse—still valuable

---

## Alternative Approaches

**Early reader endorsements:**
- Beta readers with relevant credentials or platforms
- Therapists who review the manuscript professionally
- Survivors with public platforms willing to share their experience

**Podcast appearances:**
- Often easier than blurbs
- Can generate quotes usable as endorsements
- "As featured on [podcast]" also valuable

**Professional organization endorsements:**
- Domestic violence organizations
- Therapist associations
- Survivor advocacy groups

---

## Notes on Your Unique Positioning

Your book has several angles for different endorsers:

**For trauma experts:** Emphasize the body-based recognition, nervous system integration, and somatic tools.

**For narcissism specialists:** Emphasize the 56-tactic taxonomy and Decoder Card system as practical innovation.

**For survivors/advocates:** Emphasize the accessible language, real-life examples, and validation of reader experience.

**For therapists:** Emphasize it as a client resource and the workbook-style exercises.

Customize your pitch based on what would resonate most with each potential endorser.
