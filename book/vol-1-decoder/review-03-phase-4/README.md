## Phase 4 Overview

Phase 4 is the **final proofreading pass** before publication. This phase must be completed last — any changes made after proofreading could introduce new errors.

| Reviewer | Role | Questions | Focus |
|----------|------|-----------|-------|
| **Petra** | Proofreader | 5 | Typos, formatting, final errors |

**Total Phase 4 Questions: 5**

## Why Phase 4 Must Be Last

Petra's proofreading catches:
- Typos and spelling errors
- Formatting inconsistencies
- Punctuation issues
- Cross-reference accuracy

If ANY changes are made after Phase 4 proofreading, new errors could be introduced. This is why Petra's review is absolutely final.
