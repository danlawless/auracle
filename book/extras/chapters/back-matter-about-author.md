## From Feardom to Freedom

Jennifer Brooke's journey to becoming a guide for others began with her own descent into—and emergence from—the darkness of narcissistic abuse.

A creative at heart, Jennifer has worn many hats: artist, event producer, singer, personal trainer, yoga instructor, psychotherapist, and sales professional. She holds a **Master of Science in Mental Health Counseling** and spent years working in traditional talk therapy. But none of her credentials prepared her for what she really needed to learn: how to recognize when love is actually control in disguise.

For years, she allowed herself to shrink in abusive and narcissistic relationships. Depression and anxiety became constant companions. Her self-esteem, in her own words, was "mortally wounded." Like many survivors, she had learned to seek external validation instead of trusting herself—a pattern that made her vulnerable to those who would exploit her empathy.

The breakthrough came through deep Jungian shadow work. Through transformative experiences called "Transitions," Jennifer confronted the parts of herself that had enabled toxic dynamics to continue. She released passive-aggressive patterns, negativity, blame, and the desperate need for external approval. She said goodbye to her wounded self and embraced the woman she was meant to become.

This work was brutally honest. She had to own her part. And through that ownership, she reclaimed her sovereignty.

## The Awakening

Jennifer's spiritual journey began in earnest with a powerful Kundalini awakening, guided by her coach **Peggy Butkus** and astrologer **Shira Beth Brenner**.

A pivotal moment came when she received her Reiki I initiation at Maha Rose in New York—just two weeks before her father passed away. That initiation opened her clairvoyance, and on the night her father crossed over, she experienced her first psychic vision. In Cyprus, she began writing about her communications with him through clairaudience, producing over 200 pages documenting the healing that unfolded as she learned to listen beyond the veil.

What followed was a three-year quest across the globe in search of spiritual community, healing, and self-discovery:

**Cyprus** — Where she processed her grief and opened to clairaudience

**Greece** — Where she studied astrology with **Kaypacha** (founder of Astrology for the Soul) and uncovered her soul's blueprint

**Nicaragua** — Where she spent a year breaking free from societal constraints and US cultural conditioning, connecting with transformative communities and learning to think freely

**Costa Rica & Mexico** — Where she found her spiritual home

The turning point came when she met **Diego Dosal Stieglitz**, visionary spiritual leader and co-creator of transformative experiences at Zunya, Amate events, and the Ekah Collective. Diego introduced her to **Angelina Ataide** (Angel), founder of **Escola da Aura**.

In that moment, Jennifer's path became crystal clear. She had found the modality that would become her life's work.

## Living in Community

Today, Jennifer lives her dream in Costa Rica, on a hill surrounded by lemon trees. She shares this sacred space with her partner **Daniel** (their tech wizard), and is neighbors with Diego, Karlita (an incredible chef), and their family. Angelina, Dara, and Peggy are also part of the community.

Living in community starts with an open heart, and Jennifer is grateful every day for the soul family that surrounds her—including the howler monkeys.

## The Philosophy

At the heart of Jennifer's work is a simple belief:

**Your sensitivity is not your weakness. It's your superpower.**

The same capacity that made you vulnerable to manipulation—your empathy, your attunement, your willingness to see the best in others—is the capacity that will guide you toward healing and help you build the relationships you deserve.

She believes that:

- **Naming patterns creates power.** What you can identify, you can address.
- **The body knows before the mind.** Learning to trust somatic signals is essential.
- **Healing is possible.** No matter how deep the wound, recovery is within reach.
- **Your experience matters.** What happened to you was real, and you deserve validation.
- **Sensitivity is sacred.** It's a gift to be protected, not a flaw to be fixed.
- **Community heals.** We are not meant to do this work alone.

## The Book

*The Narcissism Decoder* represents the distillation of everything Jennifer has learned—from her own journey through narcissistic relationships, from her training in mental health counseling, from years of working with clients, and from the wisdom of survivor communities.

She wrote it for the person she was years ago: confused, self-doubting, desperately needing someone to explain what was happening. She wrote it for everyone who has been told they were "too sensitive" when they were actually too perceptive. She wrote it as the guide she wished she had found.

Her hope is that these pages bring clarity to your confusion, language to your experience, and—ultimately—freedom from the patterns that have held you.
