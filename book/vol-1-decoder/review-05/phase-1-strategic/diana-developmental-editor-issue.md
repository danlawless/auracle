## Section A: Format Expansion Opportunities (Q1-Q4)

### Q1: Audio Format Optimization

**Context:** The manuscript is structured as video lesson scripts. Each lesson includes "Notes for AI Narrator" with tone, pace, and energy guidance. The curriculum totals ~10 hours across 24 lessons.

**The Question:** Should the manuscript be optimized for audio-only consumption as a parallel product?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Create audio edition: Develop audio-specific versions removing visual references ("as you see on screen") and enhancing descriptive language for ears-only consumption
- [ ] B) Hybrid approach: Add audio transition cues while keeping video references; audio listeners can follow along with course materials
- [ ] C) Video-first remains: Maintain current video-first design; audio would be derivative of video rather than standalone product
- [ ] D) No action: Keep current format; assess audio demand post-launch before investing in optimization

**Editor Comments:**
I reviewed all 24 lessons and found 47 instances of visual-dependent language:
- "As you see on screen" (12 instances)
- "The diagram shows" (8 instances)
- "Notice the visual" (7 instances)
- "Watch as..." (6 instances)
- References to on-screen text/cards (14 instances)

An audio edition would require rewriting these passages. The core emotional content translates well to audio—the validation, the tactic explanations, the recovery guidance. The Decoder Cards (Module 4) present the biggest challenge as they're inherently visual tools.

**Editor Reasoning:**
Audio-only consumption is increasingly popular for self-help content. Listeners consume during commutes, workouts, and household tasks. An audio edition could reach audience segments who won't sit for video lessons. However, creating audio-specific content is additional work.

**Clarifying Questions:**
- Do you have data on audio vs video preference in your target audience?
- Is simultaneous launch of multiple formats a goal, or would audio come later?

**Proposed Action (upon approval):**
- **If A:** I'll catalog all visual-dependent passages and draft audio-optimized alternatives for each lesson
- **If B:** I'll add audio transition cues and identify passages needing modification for clarity
- **If C:** No changes; document decision in style guide
- **If D:** No changes; flag for future consideration

### Q2: Workbook Expansion

**Context:** Each lesson includes exercises with fill-in-the-blank sections, reflection prompts, and inventories. The curriculum references a "Course Workbook (PDF)" in materials. Currently, exercises are embedded in lesson files.

**The Question:** Should exercises be expanded into a standalone comprehensive workbook?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Comprehensive workbook: Extract and expand all exercises into a standalone 50+ page workbook with additional practice scenarios, journaling prompts, and progress tracking
- [ ] B) Module workbooks: Create 5 separate module workbooks, each deep-diving into that module's concepts with expanded exercises
- [ ] C) Exercise compilation: Extract current exercises into a clean PDF without expansion—what's there is sufficient
- [ ] D) Embedded exercises: Keep exercises in lesson files; separate workbook isn't needed

**Editor Comments:**
Current exercise inventory across all 24 lessons:
- Body awareness practices: 8
- Tactic inventories/ratings: 6
- Reflection prompts: 15
- Practical application exercises: 9
- Integration exercises: 4

Total: 42 exercises currently embedded in lessons.

The exercises are well-designed but brief. Expansion opportunities include:
- Multi-scenario practice for each tactic (currently single-scenario)
- Week-by-week progress tracking templates
- Relationship inventory worksheets
- Response script customization templates
- Integration checklists

**Editor Reasoning:**
Workbooks increase engagement and completion rates. They also create an additional revenue stream. The question is whether expansion adds value or just volume. The current exercises are targeted and effective—expansion should deepen practice, not pad pages.

**Clarifying Questions:**
- Is the workbook intended as a free course companion or separate purchase?
- What format would the workbook take (digital PDF, print-on-demand, interactive)?

**Proposed Action (upon approval):**
- **If A:** I'll draft a comprehensive workbook outline with expanded exercises for each lesson
- **If B:** I'll create 5 module workbook outlines, each ~15 pages
- **If C:** I'll compile current exercises into a clean, formatted PDF
- **If D:** No changes; exercises remain embedded

### Q3: Quick Reference Card Optimization

**Context:** Module 4 teaches 37 Decoder Cards (19 Core + 18 Advanced). The curriculum mentions "37 Decoder Cards (Printable)" as included materials. Cards include: Name, Script, Translation, Function, Response.

**The Question:** Should the Decoder Cards be optimized for multiple formats?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Multi-format cards: Create printable deck, mobile app reference, and physical card deck specifications
- [ ] B) Digital-first: Optimize for mobile/digital consumption with searchable database and quick-access interface
- [ ] C) Print-first: Focus on high-quality printable PDF optimized for at-home printing or professional print
- [ ] D) Current format: The 37 cards in lesson format are sufficient; no separate card product needed

**Editor Comments:**
The Decoder Cards are the most practically valuable tool in the course. Their effectiveness depends on accessibility—can someone reach them in the moment they're being manipulated?

Current format: Cards are taught in lessons 4.2-4.4 but exist as content, not standalone reference. A separate card product would need:
- Consistent visual design across all 37 cards
- Size optimization (business card? playing card? phone screen?)
- Organization system (alphabetical? by tactic category? by frequency?)
- Quick-lookup mechanism for moment-of-crisis use

**Editor Reasoning:**
Physical cards someone can flip through, or a phone app they can quickly search, would dramatically increase real-world utility. The course teaches the cards; the product lets people use them. This is the strongest candidate for product expansion.

**Clarifying Questions:**
- Is a physical card deck something you'd produce/sell, or would this be print-at-home only?
- Would a mobile app be in scope, or is this beyond current resources?

**Proposed Action (upon approval):**
- **If A:** I'll draft specifications for print deck, mobile reference design, and format optimization guide
- **If B:** I'll design a digital-first card reference system with search and categorization
- **If C:** I'll create print-optimized PDF with professional card layouts
- **If D:** No changes; cards remain embedded in lessons

### Q4: Course Companion Book Relationship

**Context:** The curriculum references "Physical copy of *The Narcissism Decoder* (Volume 1)" as a recommended companion. This suggests a book exists or is planned alongside the video course.

**The Question:** How should the course and book relate structurally?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Course-first: The video course is the primary product; book is supplementary reference for those who prefer reading
- [ ] B) Book-first: The book is the primary product; course is experiential complement for those who prefer video/audio
- [ ] C) Parallel products: Course and book are distinct products with overlapping content but different strengths—neither depends on the other
- [ ] D) Integrated series: Course and book are designed to be used together, with each covering content the other doesn't

**Editor Comments:**
The course structure (video scripts with exercises) reads well as both video content and written prose. The question is positioning:

- If **course-first**: The book should be a condensed reference, perhaps focused on the 38 tactics and 37 cards without the lesson framework
- If **book-first**: The course should add experiential elements (guided practices, demonstrations) that print can't deliver
- If **parallel**: Each should be complete on its own with complementary but not dependent content
- If **integrated**: Clear cross-references needed, with each product assuming access to the other

**Editor Reasoning:**
This decision affects future development. If the book is the primary text, course updates should follow book updates. If the course leads, book revisions follow course revisions. Clarity now prevents conflicting versions later.

**Clarifying Questions:**
- Does the physical book exist, or is this planned for future development?
- What percentage of your audience do you expect will use both vs. one or the other?

**Proposed Action (upon approval):**
- **If A-D:** I'll document the relationship model and implications for future content development

## Section B: Content Expansion Opportunities (Q5-Q9)

### Q5: Tactic 39+ Expansion

**Context:** The Playbook (Module 2) covers 38 tactics across 5 categories: Information/Perception (8), Emotional (5), Relational (11), Punishment/Control (8), Identity/Isolation (6). The number 38 is mentioned throughout.

**The Question:** Should future editions expand the tactic count?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Expand to 50: Research and add 12 additional tactics, creating a more comprehensive playbook
- [ ] B) Expand cautiously: Add 2-5 tactics only if they represent genuinely distinct patterns not covered by existing 38
- [ ] C) Keep 38: The current count is comprehensive; additional tactics would be variants of existing ones
- [ ] D) Reduce: Some current tactics overlap; consolidate to a tighter, more memorable set (e.g., 30)

**Editor Comments:**
I analyzed the 38 tactics for coverage and overlap:

**Strong coverage:** Emotional tactics and relational tactics are well-differentiated and comprehensive. Each represents a distinct mechanism.

**Potential overlap:**
- "Hot and Cold" (17) and "Intermittent Reinforcement" (14) describe similar dynamics
- "Guilt Induction" (10) and "Obligation Creation" (19) have overlapping mechanisms
- "Gaslighting" and "Reality Distortion" could potentially merge

**Potential gaps:**
- Digital manipulation tactics (social media stalking, online reputation attacks)
- Financial control tactics (not covered in current 38)
- Coercive control in institutional settings

**Editor Reasoning:**
38 is a teachable number—substantial but not overwhelming. Expansion risks dilution; reduction risks incompleteness. The current balance seems intentional. Any changes should be strategic, not comprehensive-for-comprehensiveness-sake.

**Clarifying Questions:**
- Have users/readers identified tactics they experienced that aren't covered?
- Is there feedback suggesting the 38 feels incomplete or overwhelming?

**Proposed Action (upon approval):**
- **If A:** I'll research and draft 12 candidate new tactics with full descriptions
- **If B:** I'll identify top 3-5 gap candidates for author review
- **If C:** Document decision; no changes
- **If D:** I'll identify overlap candidates for potential consolidation

### Q6: Context-Specific Modules

**Context:** Module 3 (The Systems) covers: Trauma Bonds, Family Roles, Parental Narcissism, Romantic Manipulation, Workplace/Social. Each context gets one lesson (20-30 minutes).

**The Question:** Should specific contexts receive expanded coverage in future editions?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Expand workplace: Create dedicated workplace module (3-5 lessons) covering boss, colleague, and organizational narcissism in depth
- [ ] B) Expand family: Create dedicated family module (3-5 lessons) covering sibling, extended family, and in-law dynamics
- [ ] C) Expand romantic: Create dedicated romantic module (3-5 lessons) covering dating, marriage, co-parenting, and divorce
- [ ] D) Keep current: One lesson per context is sufficient; deeper coverage belongs in specialized courses
- [ ] E) All contexts: Expand all three contexts into dedicated modules for a comprehensive second edition

**Editor Comments:**
Current context coverage by depth:
- Family: 2 lessons (3.2, 3.3) - moderate depth
- Romantic: 1 lesson (3.4) - surface coverage
- Workplace: 1 lesson (3.5) - surface coverage

Romantic relationships receive extensive implicit coverage throughout (love bombing, trauma bonds, intermittent reinforcement examples), but workplace and extended family get lighter treatment.

Most common survivor contexts based on research:
1. Romantic partner (most resources available elsewhere)
2. Parent (well-covered in current course)
3. Workplace (significantly underserved in existing resources)
4. In-laws/extended family (very underserved)

**Editor Reasoning:**
Workplace narcissism is a gap in the market. Most narcissism resources focus on intimate relationships. A workplace-expanded edition could differentiate this course from competitors while serving an underserved audience.

**Clarifying Questions:**
- Which context generates the most questions/engagement from your audience?
- Would expanded modules increase course length beyond optimal (current ~10 hours)?

**Proposed Action (upon approval):**
- **If A:** I'll draft a 5-lesson workplace module outline
- **If B:** I'll draft a 5-lesson family module outline
- **If C:** I'll draft a 5-lesson romantic module outline
- **If D:** Document decision; no changes
- **If E:** I'll draft expansion outlines for all three contexts

### Q7: Recovery Module Expansion

**Context:** Module 5 (Response & Recovery) contains 4 lessons totaling ~1.5 hours: Energetic Remapping, Practical Responses, Exposure Questions, Moving Forward. The closing lesson references "Course 2: The Bridge" for deeper healing work.

**The Question:** Should Module 5 be expanded, or does recovery content belong in Course 2?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Expand Module 5: Add 2-3 lessons on No Contact, Gray Rock implementation, and documentation strategies
- [ ] B) Bridge content: Move some Course 2 content earlier—give Course 1 graduates a stronger foundation before the gap between courses
- [ ] C) Practical focus: Add implementation-focused content (scripts, templates, legal considerations) without expanding emotional recovery content
- [ ] D) Current scope: Recovery scope is appropriate for Course 1; deeper work belongs in Course 2

**Editor Comments:**
Current Module 5 provides:
- Nervous system practices (energetic remapping)
- 15+ response scripts
- The Exposure Questions framework
- Integration and forward planning

What's notably absent from Course 1:
- No Contact implementation guidance
- Gray Rock detailed methodology
- Documentation strategies for legal/custody situations
- Safety planning for leaving dangerous situations

These topics are mentioned but not taught. The assumption seems to be Course 2 covers implementation.

**Editor Reasoning:**
There's a gap between recognition (Course 1) and deep healing (Course 2). Some survivors need practical implementation guidance (how to actually go No Contact, how to document abuse) before they're ready for the inner work of Course 2. This practical bridge might belong in Course 1's final module.

**Clarifying Questions:**
- How long is the typical gap between completing Course 1 and starting Course 2?
- Do you receive questions asking for implementation guidance that Course 1 doesn't provide?

**Proposed Action (upon approval):**
- **If A:** I'll draft 2-3 additional lesson outlines for Module 5
- **If B:** I'll identify Course 2 content that could move to Course 1
- **If C:** I'll draft practical implementation content (scripts, templates, documentation guide)
- **If D:** Document decision; current scope maintained

### Q8: Men's Experience Integration

**Context:** The course uses gender-neutral language throughout ("they," "the narcissist," "your partner"). Examples include both male and female narcissists. However, exercises and Field Notes may skew toward experiences more commonly reported by women.

**The Question:** Should future editions more explicitly address men's experiences as survivors?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Integrated approach: Add male survivor examples, Field Notes, and specific challenges (stigma, disbelief, custody bias) throughout
- [ ] B) Dedicated section: Add a dedicated lesson or module section addressing unique challenges male survivors face
- [ ] C) Current approach: Gender-neutral language is sufficient; specific gendering could alienate some audience segments
- [ ] D) Separate product: Male survivor experience warrants its own course or course track, not integration into this course

**Editor Comments:**
Current gender representation scan:
- Pronouns: Consistently gender-neutral ("they/them" for narcissist, "you" for survivor)
- Examples: ~60% female survivor perspective, ~30% male survivor, ~10% unclear
- Field Notes: Did not find explicit male survivor Field Notes in the reviewed lessons
- Challenges unique to male survivors (mentioned): 0 instances

Male survivors of narcissistic abuse are significantly underserved by existing resources. They face additional barriers: societal expectations of male strength, disbelief from support systems, family court biases, and lack of male-specific resources.

**Editor Reasoning:**
Explicit acknowledgment that men experience this too—and face unique challenges—could expand reach without alienating the current audience. The integrated approach (A) seems lower risk than a dedicated section (B) which might feel tacked-on.

**Clarifying Questions:**
- What percentage of your current audience identifies as male?
- Have you received feedback from male survivors about the course?

**Proposed Action (upon approval):**
- **If A:** I'll identify integration points and draft male survivor examples, Field Notes, and challenge acknowledgments
- **If B:** I'll draft a dedicated lesson addressing male survivor experience
- **If C:** Document decision; maintain current gender-neutral approach
- **If D:** Note for future product development; no changes to Course 1

### Q9: Cultural Context Expansion

**Context:** The course appears written from a Western/North American perspective. Examples reference Western family structures, workplace norms, and relationship expectations.

**The Question:** Should future editions expand cultural context coverage?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) International examples: Add examples from diverse cultural contexts showing how manipulation manifests differently across cultures
- [ ] B) Cultural acknowledgment: Add framing that acknowledges the Western perspective and invites cultural adaptation without adding specific examples
- [ ] C) Translated adaptations: Plan for culturally adapted versions (not just translations) for key international markets
- [ ] D) Current scope: The core patterns are universal; cultural specificity isn't necessary

**Editor Comments:**
Cultural elements that may not translate universally:
- Nuclear family assumptions (some cultures have multi-generational households as norm)
- Individual boundaries concept (collectivist cultures have different boundary norms)
- Workplace hierarchy expectations (vary significantly by culture)
- "Leaving" as solution (not always possible/appropriate in all cultural contexts)
- Direct communication as healthy (indirect communication is valued in some cultures)

The core manipulation patterns (gaslighting, triangulation, love bombing) appear universal. The responses and recovery paths may need cultural adaptation.

**Editor Reasoning:**
International reach is a growth opportunity, but meaningful cultural adaptation requires more than adding examples—it requires understanding how narcissism manifests and is addressed within different cultural frameworks. This may be beyond scope for Course 1 but worth considering for expansion.

**Clarifying Questions:**
- What percentage of your audience is outside North America?
- Are there specific cultural contexts you've received feedback from?

**Proposed Action (upon approval):**
- **If A:** I'll research and draft cultural context examples for 3-5 major cultural frameworks
- **If B:** I'll draft framing language for cultural acknowledgment
- **If C:** I'll outline requirements for culturally adapted versions
- **If D:** Document decision; no changes

## Section C: Structural Refinement (Q10-Q13)

### Q10: Module Length Balance

**Context:** Module lengths vary: Module 1 (4 lessons, ~2h), Module 2 (6 lessons, ~2.5h), Module 3 (5 lessons, ~2h), Module 4 (5 lessons, ~2h), Module 5 (4 lessons, ~1.5h). Total ~10 hours across 24 lessons.

**The Question:** Should module lengths be rebalanced?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Extend Module 5: Recovery content is most actionable; extending from 1.5h to 2.5h would match other modules
- [ ] B) Condense Module 2: 38 tactics across 2.5 hours may overwhelm; condensing to 2 hours with faster pace could improve retention
- [ ] C) Add Module 6: Create a separate "Implementation" module for practical application, reducing pressure on Module 5
- [ ] D) Current balance: The variation in module length reflects content needs; no rebalancing needed

**Editor Comments:**
Completion rate research suggests:
- Modules 1-3 (Recognition, Playbook, Systems): High engagement, information-dense
- Module 4 (Decoder Cards): Practical tools, reference material
- Module 5 (Recovery): Where action happens, but shortest module

Module 5 being shortest may create a "cliff" effect—lots of information, then limited guidance on what to do with it. Course 2 bridges this, but not everyone continues.

**Editor Reasoning:**
The current structure front-loads understanding and back-loads action. For survivors who need immediate practical guidance, this ordering might delay what they need most. However, recognition must precede effective response, so the ordering has logic.

**Proposed Action (upon approval):**
- **If A:** I'll draft extended Module 5 content outline
- **If B:** I'll identify Module 2 condensation opportunities
- **If C:** I'll draft Module 6 outline
- **If D:** Document decision; current balance maintained

**Author Response:**
_[Space for author to respond]_

### Q11: Lesson Length Consistency

**Context:** Individual lessons range from 15 to 30 minutes. The variation appears content-driven rather than standardized.

**The Question:** Should lesson lengths be standardized?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Standardize to 20 minutes: Split longer lessons, combine shorter ones for consistent experience
- [ ] B) Standardize to 25 minutes: Slight adjustment for consistency while accommodating content needs
- [ ] C) Keep variable: Content should dictate length, not arbitrary time targets
- [ ] D) Create short version: Keep current lengths but create a "15-minute highlights" version of each lesson for review/refresh

**Editor Comments:**
Current lesson length distribution:
- 15 minutes: 5 lessons (intro/framework lessons)
- 20 minutes: 9 lessons
- 25 minutes: 8 lessons
- 30 minutes: 2 lessons (Trauma Bonds, Core Cards Part 1)

The variation seems intentional—introductory and closing lessons are shorter, content-heavy lessons are longer. This matches how people actually learn.

**Editor Reasoning:**
Forced standardization often hurts content. A 30-minute lesson squeezed to 20 minutes loses depth; a 15-minute lesson padded to 20 minutes adds fluff. The current variable approach seems sound.

**Proposed Action (upon approval):**
- **If A:** I'll identify split/combine candidates and draft adjustments
- **If B:** I'll identify adjustment candidates
- **If C:** Document decision; maintain variable approach
- **If D:** I'll draft 15-minute highlight outlines for each lesson

### Q12: Entry Point Flexibility

**Context:** The course is designed for linear consumption: Module 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5. The curriculum recommends "complete each module before moving to the next."

**The Question:** Should the course support non-linear entry points?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Create entry assessments: Add a quiz to help learners identify which module to start with based on their current state
- [ ] B) Create module prerequisites: Clearly state what prior knowledge each module assumes, allowing informed skipping
- [ ] C) Create fast-track: A 3-hour "essential concepts" track for those who don't need full course
- [ ] D) Maintain linear: The progressive structure is intentional; non-linear access would undermine comprehension

**Editor Comments:**
Current structure assumes linear progression:
- Module 1 establishes body awareness (used throughout)
- Module 2 teaches tactics (referenced in Modules 3-5)
- Module 3 applies tactics to contexts (requires Module 2)
- Module 4 provides tools (requires Modules 1-2)
- Module 5 enables response (requires all previous)

However, some learners arrive with partial knowledge:
- Therapists who understand tactics but need the Decoder Cards
- Survivors who've done recovery work but need recognition tools
- Those who've read the book and want specific module content

**Editor Reasoning:**
Strict linearity may turn away learners who don't need the full foundation. Flexible entry could increase accessibility. The risk is learners skipping foundational content they actually need.

**Proposed Action (upon approval):**
- **If A:** I'll draft an entry assessment quiz with module recommendations
- **If B:** I'll write module prerequisites documentation
- **If C:** I'll outline a 3-hour fast-track version
- **If D:** Document decision; maintain linear structure

**Author Response:**

### Q13: Interstitial Content

**Context:** The course moves directly from lesson to lesson within modules. There are no explicit "pause points" or reflection breaks built into the structure beyond exercise sections.

**The Question:** Should interstitial content be added between lessons or modules?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Module interludes: Add 5-minute "integration pause" videos between modules for processing heavy content
- [ ] B) Lesson bridges: Add 1-minute transition content between lessons within modules
- [ ] C) Written interludes: Add short written reflection prompts between lessons (not video)
- [ ] D) Self-directed: Trust learners to pace themselves; interstitials aren't necessary

**Editor Comments:**
The curriculum includes a "Self-Care Protocol" in the overview:
> "If overwhelmed: Pause the lesson, Use the 3-3-3 Rule, Ground with exercises in Lesson 5.1, Return when ready"

This is reactive (what to do when overwhelmed) rather than preventive (built-in processing time). Given the heavy emotional content—especially in Modules 2 and 3—proactive integration time could prevent overwhelm.

**Editor Reasoning:**
Trauma content requires processing time. Rushing through tactics and systems without pause may overwhelm the nervous system this course aims to heal. Brief interludes could model healthy pacing.

**Proposed Action (upon approval):**
- **If A:** I'll draft 5 module interlude concepts
- **If B:** I'll draft lesson bridge concepts
- **If C:** I'll draft written reflection prompts
- **If D:** Document decision; trust self-directed pacing

## Section D: Future Development (Q14-Q15)

### Q14: Series Architecture

**Context:** The course references a "Sovereignty Series" with stages: SEE → HEAL → STAND → LIVE → GIVE → SERVE → THRIVE → BECOME. Course 1 covers SEE; Course 2 (The Bridge) covers HEAL.

**The Question:** Should Course 1 more explicitly establish the series architecture?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Expand series preview: Add detailed preview of Courses 2-8 with what each covers, who it's for, and how they connect
- [ ] B) Current preview: The brief mention in Lesson 5.4 is sufficient; don't oversell future courses
- [ ] C) Progress framework: Add a "Sovereignty Journey" visual/framework showing where Course 1 fits in the larger transformation
- [ ] D) Standalone framing: Frame Course 1 as complete in itself; series mention is optional context

**Editor Comments:**
Current series mention in Lesson 5.4:
> "The full journey from survival to sovereignty includes: HEAL, STAND, LIVE, GIVE, SERVE, THRIVE, BECOME. Each of these stages builds on recognition."

This is brief and forward-looking but doesn't help learners understand the full architecture or where they are in the journey.

**Editor Reasoning:**
A clear series architecture helps learners:
- Understand Course 1's role in larger transformation
- Make informed decisions about continuing
- Feel progress by knowing where they are

The risk is that extensive upselling feels manipulative in a course about recognizing manipulation.

**Proposed Action (upon approval):**
- **If A:** I'll draft expanded series preview content
- **If B:** Document decision; maintain current brief mention
- **If C:** I'll design a "Sovereignty Journey" progress framework
- **If D:** I'll reframe Course 1 as standalone with optional continuation

### Q15: Version Control Strategy

**Context:** This is Review Round 5. The manuscript has evolved significantly through multiple review rounds. Future updates and editions are likely.

**The Question:** What versioning approach should guide future updates?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Edition model: Major updates become "Second Edition," "Third Edition" with clear delineation between versions
- [ ] B) Continuous update: Course updates continuously; version numbers track changes but aren't marketed
- [ ] C) Dated versions: "2026 Edition," "2027 Edition" with annual content reviews
- [ ] D) Feature versions: Name versions by major feature additions ("Extended Edition," "Complete Edition")

**Editor Comments:**
Current state establishes a solid first edition. Future changes could include:
- Content additions (new tactics, expanded modules)
- Format additions (audio, workbook, cards)
- Corrections and refinements
- Response to user feedback

Each versioning approach has different implications for existing students, marketing, and content management.

**Editor Reasoning:**
Clear versioning helps students know what they have and what's new. It also helps with support (which version are they using?) and marketing (what's new in this edition?). The approach should match your update frequency and business model.

**Proposed Action (upon approval):**
- **If A-D:** I'll document the versioning strategy and create guidelines for future updates

## Summary

This review focuses on **post-publication opportunities** rather than corrections—the manuscript is publication-ready with excellent coherence.

| Section | Questions | Focus |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| A: Format Expansion | Q1-Q4 | Audio, workbook, cards, book relationship |
| B: Content Expansion | Q5-Q9 | Tactics, contexts, recovery, demographics, culture |
| C: Structural Refinement | Q10-Q13 | Module balance, lesson length, entry points, interludes |
| D: Future Development | Q14-Q15 | Series architecture, versioning |

**My Top 3 Recommendations:**

1. **Q3 (Decoder Cards):** The cards are the most practically valuable tool. Optimizing them for real-world access (phone, printable, physical) would significantly increase course impact.

2. **Q6 (Workplace Expansion):** Workplace narcissism is underserved in the market. Expanding this context could differentiate the course and reach an underserved audience.

3. **Q7 (Recovery Expansion):** The gap between recognition and Course 2's deep healing could strand some learners. Practical implementation guidance in Course 1 would provide immediate value.
