# Self-Regulation Practices Collection

> Practical tools and practices for integration across "The Sovereignty Series"

---

## Purpose

These practices are designed to be:
- **Somatic** — working with the body, not just the mind
- **Brief** — completable in 1-5 minutes
- **Repeatable** — building capacity through repetition
- **Specific** — addressing particular patterns

---

## Volume 2: The Bridge — Practices

### Practice: Real-Time Repair Litmus Test
*(60–90 seconds, no analysis required)*

**Step 1 — Say One True Sentence**

Use a simple, non-accusatory line:
- "I need to slow this down."
- "I'm not available for that right now."
- "Something in me tightened just now."

**Rule:** Don't explain. Don't justify.

**Step 2 — Observe Their First Response**

**PASS (Green):**
- They pause
- They soften or slow
- They acknowledge impact
- They don't reach for access

**FAIL (Red):**
- They explain intent
- They minimize
- They push for reassurance
- They frame your boundary as conflict

**Step 3 — Check Your Body (10 seconds)**

Ask silently:
- Did my chest soften or tighten?
- Did my breath deepen or shorten?
- Do I feel more choice—or pressure?

**Step 4 — Hold for One Beat Longer**

If they passed: Say nothing. Let behavior confirm safety.
If they failed: "I'm going to take space." Then stop engaging.

**Decision Rule:** One fail early: slow down. Two fails: disengage. Pattern fails: exit.

### Practice: The 72-Hour Rule

Before making any significant relationship decision:

**Wait 72 hours.**

- Don't reply to an intense message immediately
- Don't commit when activated
- Don't have a "big talk" when dysregulated
- Don't make permanent decisions from temporary emotions

**After 72 hours, ask:**
- Does this still feel as urgent?
- What does my regulated self think?
- What does the pattern over time suggest?

---

### Practice: The Energy Audit

After each date or significant interaction, check:

**Regulated energy:**
- Calm
- Grounded
- Curious but not obsessive
- Able to focus on other things
- Present in your body

**Activated energy:**
- Thinking about them constantly
- Analyzing every message
- Anxious about next contact
- Already imagining the future
- Sleep disruption

Neither is "right" — but activated energy is information.

## Volume 3: Sovereignty — Practices

### Practice: Stay Without Paying

*For gift-giving as regulation*

**When to Use:**
- After you don't give when you normally would
- When guilt or anxiety spikes
- When you notice mental "accounting"
- When you feel the urge to compensate

**The Practice:**

**1. Name the Activation**

"This is my body trying to earn safety."

*Naming shifts from identity to pattern.*

**2. Orient to Presence**

Look around and name:
- 3 things you can see
- 2 things you can hear
- 1 sensation in your body

**3. Place a Hand on Your Chest**

Say: "I am allowed to stay without bringing anything."

*Don't force belief. Just let the words exist.*

**4. Delay the Action**

Make a 24-hour rule: No gifts, no offers, no explanations.

**5. Track the Outcome**

Ask later:
- Did the connection survive?
- Did anyone punish me?
- Did I lose belonging?

*Almost always, the answer is no.*

**Integration Sentence:** "I can feel uncomfortable and still belong."

---

### Practice: Personal Decision Filter

*For earned belonging to chosen presence*

**Step 1: Body Check (Non-Negotiable)**

Pause. Ask your body (not your mind):
- Do I feel expansive or tight?
- Is there urgency?
- Is there fear of disappointing?
- Is there a sense of debt or pressure?

**Rule:** If your chest is tight or breath shallow → pause. No decision made from contraction is clean.

**Step 2: Motive Clarity**

Complete: "I want to give this because __________."

**Watch for:**
- "…so I don't feel guilty"
- "…so I don't owe anyone"
- "…so I'm allowed to stay"

**Clean motives sound like:**
- "…because I genuinely want to"
- "…because it feels light"
- "…because I have overflow"

**Step 3: Freedom Test**

Ask: *If I didn't give this, would I still feel okay being here?*

If no → you are trying to earn safety.

**Step 4: Resentment Forecast**

Ask: *Would I feel unseen or resentful if this isn't acknowledged?*

If yes → pause. That's prepaid resentment.

**Step 5: Exit Option**

Ask: *Can I give this without expectation of outcome?*

If not → it's a transaction, not a gift.

**Final Rule:** If giving costs my nervous system peace, it is not generosity.

### Practice: Interrupting Authority Imprinting

**Step 1: Add a Buffer Phrase**

When someone says something, silently respond: "That's a statement, not a verdict."

**Step 2: Shrink the Scope**

Ask:
- "Is this true always?"
- "Is this true for everyone?"
- "Is this true for me right now?"

**Step 3: Reclaim Authorship**

Say (internally or aloud): "I'll take what fits."

**Somatic Cue:** If chest tightens or stomach drops:
- Press feet gently into the floor
- Exhale longer than you inhale
- Look around and name 3 neutral objects

---

### Practice: Staying Landed

*For reflexive counterbalancing*

**Before offering "the other side," ask:**
- Am I adding depth — or avoiding landing?
- Am I afraid of being seen as wrong?
- What do I think, if I don't balance it?

**Scripts:**
- "What I actually think is ___."
- "If I had to choose, I'd say ___."
- "I'm going to let that stand."
- "I don't need to qualify this yet."
- "This is my view." (Full stop)

**If there's fear in the body — that's the cue to stay.**

---

### Practice: Allowing Imbalance

**Exercise 1: The Uneven Breath**

1. Inhale for 4 counts
2. Exhale for 6 counts
3. Notice the imbalance
4. Let it be uncomfortable for one more breath
5. Return to normal

**Exercise 2: Letting Someone Lead**

1. In a conversation, notice when you want to add nuance
2. Instead, say: "Tell me more"
3. Let the other person's idea fully form
4. Notice what happens in your body
5. Name silently: "I can follow without disappearing"

**Exercise 3: Taking the Lead**

1. In a group, notice when leadership is vacant
2. Instead of waiting, say: "I'll take point on this"
3. Offer clear direction
4. Notice the discomfort
5. Name silently: "I can lead without becoming dangerous"

---

### Practice: Regret Loop Interruption

*For counterfactual rumination*

**1. Name the Loop**

"This is my mind scanning for safety."

**2. Separate Choice from Outcome**

"I made the best choice I could with the information and nervous system I had."

**3. Bring It Back to the Body**

- Feel your feet
- Notice temperature
- Take a long exhale

**4. Ask a Better Question**

Instead of "Why didn't I do that?"
Try: "What am I longing for right now?"

Often the answer isn't the missed action — it's connection, play, rest, novelty, reassurance.

*Meet that need in the present.*

---

## Volume 4: Embodied Leadership — Practices

### Practice: Neutral Presence Posture

*For maintaining sovereignty in groups*

**The Posture:**
- Relax shoulders
- Slightly slower speech
- Minimal explanation
- No rescuing, no convincing

**Language:**
- "That's not my experience."
- "I see it differently."
- "I'll let that land as it is."
- "Interesting."

Then stop talking.

**Why This Works:** You stop providing regulation for others. The group must regulate itself.

---

### Practice: Integrity Check (Before Sharing Insight)

**Question 1:** Is this for service or status?

**Question 2:** Can I be wrong?

**Question 3:** Am I attached to the outcome?

**Question 4:** Would I share this if no one knew it came from me?

**Question 5:** How would I feel if they rejected this?

**Question 6:** Am I leaving them with more agency or less?

---

### Practice: The Shadow Inventory

*Weekly or monthly reflection*

**Question 1:** This week, where did I need to be special?

**Question 2:** Where did I compete for wisdom or insight?

**Question 3:** When did I resist feedback most strongly?

**Question 4:** Where did I share insight that was more about me than them?

**Question 5:** What would the people around me say about my shadow—if they felt safe to say it?

**Question 6:** Am I willing to ask them?

---

### Practice: The Ordinary Day

*Periodically, practice being nobody special*

- Don't offer insight
- Don't guide
- Don't explain
- Don't be wise
- Just be present
- Let others lead
- Receive instead of give
- Be ordinary

Notice what this brings up. Boredom? Discomfort? Relief?

*What you feel when you can't be special is data about your shadow.*
