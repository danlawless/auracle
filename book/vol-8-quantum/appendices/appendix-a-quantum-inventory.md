# Appendix A: The Quantum Inventory

## A Self-Assessment for the Journey

---

This inventory is designed to help you assess where you are in relationship to the quantum you. It's not a test with right or wrong answers. It's a tool for awareness—a way to see patterns, track changes, and identify areas for attention.

Take this inventory before reading the volume, then again after. Notice what shifts.

## Section 1: Identification

*How closely do you identify with your conditioning versus awareness itself?*

Rate each statement from 1 (rarely true) to 5 (almost always true):

| Statement | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| I feel like I am my thoughts | | | | | |
| My mood determines who I am | | | | | |
| When I fail, I feel I am a failure | | | | | |
| My sense of self depends on others' opinions | | | | | |
| I can't distinguish between myself and my emotions | | | | | |
| I take my identity as fixed and permanent | | | | | |
| I believe my personality is who I really am | | | | | |
| When criticized, my whole sense of self feels attacked | | | | | |

**Higher scores** indicate stronger identification with conditioned self.
**Lower scores** indicate more spaciousness around identity.

## Section 2: Presence

*How present are you in daily life?*

Rate each statement from 1 (rarely true) to 5 (almost always true):

| Statement | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| I am fully here in the present moment | | | | | |
| I notice when my attention has drifted | | | | | |
| I can feel my body throughout the day | | | | | |

| I can pause before reacting | | | | | |
| I experience moments of deep stillness | | | | | |
| I am present with others when we're together | | | | | |

**Higher scores** indicate stronger presence capacity.
**Lower scores** indicate areas for practice.

## Section 3: Trust and Allowing

*How much do you trust the flow of life?*

Rate each statement from 1 (rarely true) to 5 (almost always true):

| Statement | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| I trust that life is fundamentally supportive | | | | | |
| I can allow things to unfold without forcing | | | | | |
| I release control when it's not serving | | | | | |
| I follow my intuition even when it's not logical | | | | | |
| I accept what is while still working for change | | | | | |
| I feel connected to something larger than myself | | | | | |
| I notice and appreciate synchronicities | | | | | |
| I can want things without desperate grasping | | | | | |

**Higher scores** indicate stronger trust and allowing.
**Lower scores** indicate areas where trust might be developed.

## Section 4: Fear and Resistance

*How do you relate to fear and resistance?*

Rate each statement from 1 (rarely true) to 5 (almost always true):

| Statement | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fear stops me from doing what I want | | | | | |
| I resist what's happening instead of accepting it | | | | | |
| I avoid uncomfortable feelings | | | | | |
| I fight against reality when it's not what I want | | | | | |
| My body is chronically tense | | | | | |
| I spend energy wishing things were different | | | | | |
| I contract when uncertainty arises | | | | | |
| I often feel I'm swimming upstream | | | | | |

**Lower scores** indicate healthier relationship with fear and resistance.
**Higher scores** indicate areas for attention.

## Section 5: Embodiment

*How connected are you to your body?*

Rate each statement from 1 (rarely true) to 5 (almost always true):

| Statement | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| I feel at home in my body | | | | | |
| I trust my body's signals | | | | | |
| I can sense subtle body sensations | | | | | |
| My body feels like an ally, not an obstacle | | | | | |
| I notice how different situations affect my body | | | | | |
| I can use body awareness to make decisions | | | | | |
| I am comfortable receiving pleasure | | | | | |
| I feel my body is a portal for awareness | | | | | |

**Higher scores** indicate strong embodiment.
**Lower scores** indicate opportunity for body-connection work.

## Section 6: The Quantum You

*How familiar is the quantum you to you?*

Rate each statement from 1 (rarely true) to 5 (almost always true):

| Statement | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| I have glimpsed awareness as what I am | | | | | |
| I sometimes feel I am the space in which experience occurs | | | | | |
| I can be with difficult experiences without drowning | | | | | |
| I sense that I'm more than my personality | | | | | |
| I have moments where the seeker and sought feel the same | | | | | |
| I can rest as awareness itself | | | | | |
| The world sometimes feels more connected than separate | | | | | |
| I have a sense of the vastness I am | | | | | |

**Higher scores** indicate more familiarity with the quantum you.
**Lower scores** indicate the journey is just beginning.

## Scoring Guide

This isn't about a total score. It's about patterns.

**Look for:**

- Which sections have the lowest scores? These may need the most attention.
- Which sections have the highest? These are your strengths.
- Are there individual items that surprise you?
- What themes emerge across sections?

---

## Questions for Reflection

After completing the inventory:

1. What surprised you about your responses?
2. Which area feels most ready for growth?
3. Which area feels most challenging?
4. What would be different if your lowest-scored items became higher?
5. What one practice might address your most important area?

---

## Tracking Changes

Take this inventory again after completing the volume.

Compare scores:
- Where did things shift?
- Where did things stay the same?
- What practices seemed to have the most impact?

---

## The Purpose of Assessment

The inventory is not judgment. It's not comparison. It's not about achieving perfect scores.

It's awareness.

When you know where you are, you know what to practice.

When you know what to practice, practice becomes possible.

When you practice, the quantum you becomes more familiar.

**The assessment is not the point. The awareness it creates is the point.**
