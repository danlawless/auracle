## Key Terms for Ethical Guidance

---

## B

**Boundaries (Professional)**
Clear limits defining the helping relationship. Protect both guide and client from harm.

---

## C

**Containment**
The capacity to hold space for another's experience without being destabilized or needing to fix.

**Counter-transference**
Unconscious reactions triggered in the guide by the client. Essential to notice and work with.

---

## D

**Dual Relationships**
Having multiple roles with the same person (guide and friend, guide and business partner). Generally to be avoided or carefully managed.

---

## E

**Ethical Guidance**
Helping that serves the client's autonomy rather than the guide's needs. Leaves people with more agency, not less.

---

## H

**Helping as Hiding**
Using the helper role to avoid one's own work. The shadow of guidance.

**Identity Mirroring (Group Pattern)**
When group members respond to disclosures with "me too," flattening individual experience into collective sameness. Creates pseudo-belonging through conformity.

**Insight-Projection**
Using insight to control others while avoiding your own material. Offering analysis without invitation to maintain the expert position and regulate your own anxiety.

---

## P

**Power Differential**
The inherent imbalance in helping relationships. The guide has more power. This must be held responsibly.

**Projection**
When clients (or guides) see their own material in the other person.

---

## R

**Referral**
Recognizing when a client needs something beyond your scope and connecting them with appropriate resources.

---

## S

**Scope of Practice**
The boundaries of your training and competence. Working within scope is ethical; working beyond it is harmful.

**Session Hygiene**
Practices for clearing before and after client contact. Essential for sustainable helping.

**Spiritual Language as Social Power**
Using spiritual terminology strategically—"That's your shadow," "You're projecting"—to deflect feedback, establish hierarchy, or bypass boundaries.

---

## T

**Transference**
Client's unconscious projection of feelings from past relationships onto the guide.
