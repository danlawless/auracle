- [ ] A) Keep third person in Field Notes (intentional distance)
- [x] B) Convert to second person for consistency
- [ ] C) Keep third person but add framing note
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

**Reasoning:** Converting Field Notes to second person maintains voice consistency throughout the manuscript and keeps the intimate connection with the reader unbroken.

- [x] A) Variation is intentional — clinical for science, conversational for support
- [ ] B) Lean more clinical throughout
- [ ] C) Lean more conversational throughout
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

**Reasoning:** The tonal variation serves the content—clinical language grounds the scientific explanations while conversational tone provides warmth during supportive sections. This rhythm is intentional and effective.

- [ ] B) Add subsection breaks for longer cards
- [x] C) Review longest cards individually

- [x] A) Intentional pattern — contractions conversational, full forms clinical
- [ ] B) Standardize to contractions throughout
