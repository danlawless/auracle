# Chapter 16: Pricing, Charging & Receiving

## PART IV: PURPOSE & BUILDING

---

## The Money Moment

---

You've done the work. Found your purpose. Built something worth offering.

Now comes the moment that undoes many trauma survivors:

**You have to name a price. Charge for it. Receive payment.**

For some, this feels like a simple transaction.

For those who survived narcissistic dynamics, it can feel like walking through fire.

Because money was weaponized. Because value was conditional. Because receiving was controlled, mocked, or used against you.

This chapter is about reclaiming your relationship with money in business. Not just the practical mechanics—the deep rewiring required to charge what you're worth and actually receive it.

**Core truth:** Your capacity to receive money is directly connected to your sense of worthiness. Healing one heals the other.

## Field Note (Before): The One Who Couldn't Charge

She knew her work was good.

Clients transformed. Testimonials glowed. Referrals came steadily.

But when it came to naming her price, something broke.

She'd quote a number—always lower than she'd planned. Then immediately offer a discount, before they even asked.

If they hesitated, she'd panic. "We can work something out." "Pay what you can." "Don't worry about it."

She was running a charity, not a business. And she was exhausted.

In therapy, she traced it back: In the relationship, her contribution was never enough. No matter how much she gave, he demanded more. Her value was always in question.

She'd internalized it: *I'm not worth what I'm asking. They'll reject me if I charge what this is really worth.*

The underpricing wasn't humility. It was fear.

---

## Field Note (After): The One Who Named Her Worth

The shift took time.

She had to feel the fear of charging—and charge anyway. Had to sit with the discomfort of silence after naming her price—and not fill it with discounts.

The first time she held her number without flinching, she shook for an hour afterward.

The client said yes.

Then another. And another.

She realized: the people who wanted what she offered could afford what she charged. The ones who couldn't weren't her clients—and never had been.

Her income doubled within a year. Not because she worked more. Because she stopped leaking value through undercharging.

She was receiving now. Actually receiving.

---

## Why Charging Is Hard After Trauma

Money and worth get tangled in toxic dynamics.

**In narcissistic relationships:**
- Your value was constantly questioned
- Money was used as control
- Your contributions were diminished or invisible
- Asking for anything brought punishment
- You were told you didn't deserve what you wanted
- Receiving came with strings attached

**In the family of origin:**
- Money was scarce or chaotic
- Asking for resources brought shame or guilt
- Self-worth and earning got confused
- You learned to minimize your needs
- Receiving felt dangerous or obligating

**The result:** Deep confusion between self-worth and financial worth. A collapsed capacity to name value. Fear of receiving anything.

---

## The Receiving Problem

Before we talk about charging, we need to talk about receiving.

**For many trauma survivors, receiving is the core issue:**

**Receiving feels vulnerable.** When you receive, you're in a position of need. The relationship taught you that showing need is dangerous.

**Receiving creates obligation.** In the dynamic, nothing was free. Receiving meant owing. Gifts became debts.

**Receiving invites criticism.** "You always want more." "You're never satisfied." "After everything I've given you."

**Receiving means being seen.** Someone has to know you need something. That visibility feels exposing.

**The nervous system learned:** Receiving is dangerous. Don't need. Don't ask. Don't receive.

**But business requires receiving.** Money, recognition, appreciation, payment. If you can't receive, you can't sustain.

---

## Neuroscience Lens: The Blocked Receive

The capacity to receive lives in the nervous system.

**What happens when receiving is blocked:**

**Deflection.** Compliments are dismissed. Help is refused. Payment feels awkward.

**Contraction.** The body tightens against receiving. There's a visceral "no" before the cognitive choice.

**Immediate reciprocity urge.** Can't receive without immediately giving back. The imbalance feels intolerable.

**Guilt or shame.** After receiving anything, guilt floods. Shame about needing. Shame about having.

**What healthy receiving looks like:**

**Expansion.** The body opens to receive. There's space for what's offered.

**Settling.** Receiving settles the system rather than activating it.

**Simple thank you.** No deflection. No immediate reciprocation. Just receiving.

**Pleasure.** Actually enjoying what's received without guilt.

**The shift:** This isn't about affirmations. It's about nervous system retraining. The body has to learn that receiving is safe.

## The Four Money Wounds

Behind most pricing struggles are specific wounds:

**1. The Worthiness Wound**
"I'm not worth what I'm asking."
This creates underpricing, over-delivering, and constant apologizing for rates.

**2. The Receiving Wound**
"I can't take their money."
This creates discomfort with payment, discounts offered before requested, and guilt about income.

**3. The Visibility Wound**
"If I charge that much, who do I think I am?"
This creates hiding behind low prices so success doesn't invite attack.

**4. The Scarcity Wound**
"There isn't enough—I have to take anything I can get."
This creates taking every client regardless of fit, racing to the bottom on price.

**Identifying your primary wound** helps you work with it directly. Most people have more than one, but one is usually dominant.

## Field Note: The Scarcity That Didn't Match Reality

His bank account was stable. Years of recovery had built savings. He wasn't in danger.

But every time a potential client hesitated, his nervous system screamed: *Take the deal. Take anything. You'll end up with nothing.*

He'd discount. He'd add extra services. He'd practically beg.

In reality, he could afford to let clients walk. He had other leads. His business was solid.

But his body still lived in the marriage—when he had to ask permission to spend, when resources were controlled, when security could vanish at any moment.

The scarcity was a ghost. It haunted a room he no longer lived in.

Healing meant teaching his nervous system that now was different from then. That he could say no. That he could let a client walk. That enough existed.

---

## Pricing Practically: The Mechanics

Let's talk mechanics before going deeper.

**Factors in pricing:**
- What the market will bear (research competitors)
- Cost of delivering the service (time, expenses, overhead)
- Value to the client (what transformation is worth)
- Desired income (what you need to earn to sustain)
- Your positioning (premium vs. accessible)

**Common pricing mistakes:**
- Pricing by the hour when you should price by value
- Pricing based on what you'd pay, not what clients will pay
- Pricing based on competitor comparison without considering positioning
- Pricing based on fear rather than math

**A useful question:** If I charge X, how many clients do I need at what capacity to earn what I need?

Sometimes the answer reveals that low prices require unsustainable volume. The math matters.

---

## Pricing Emotionally: The Deeper Work

The mechanics are simple. The emotional work is harder.

**What happens when you try to raise prices:**

**Fear of rejection.** "They'll say no."
*Reality:* Some will. Others won't. The ones who stay are often better clients.

**Imposter syndrome activation.** "Who am I to charge that?"
*Reality:* Your imposter syndrome isn't an accurate assessment of your value.

**Fear of losing everything.** "If I charge more, I'll have no clients."
*Reality:* Usually false. Often, higher prices attract better clients.

**Guilt.** "It feels wrong to make money from this."
*Reality:* Value exchange isn't exploitation. You're offering something; they're paying for it.

**The practice:** Feel the fear. Charge anyway. Let your nervous system learn that charging appropriately doesn't result in catastrophe.

---

## The Discount Reflex

Watch for the discount reflex—the automatic lowering of price before being asked.

**Signs of the discount reflex:**
- Quoting a number, then immediately softening it
- Offering payment plans before they're requested
- Adding extra services to "justify" the price
- Apologizing for your rates
- Saying "but we can talk about it" after stating price

**What's underneath:**
- Fear of rejection
- Discomfort with receiving
- Internalized message that you're not worth it
- Survival programming from the relationship

**The practice:** Quote your price. Stop talking. Let the silence exist.

The discomfort is temporary. The underprice is permanent.

---

## When Clients Push Back on Price

Some will negotiate. Some will complain. Some will try to diminish your value.

**Sovereign responses:**

**To price pushback:**
"I understand. This is my rate for the work. If it doesn't fit your budget, I'm happy to recommend alternatives."

**To "It's too expensive":**
"I hear you. This is the investment for the transformation we're discussing. It's not the right fit for everyone."

**To comparison shopping:**
"I can only speak to what I offer and what it costs. You should choose what feels right for you."

**To manipulation (guilt-tripping, shaming):**
This is a red flag. Clients who manipulate during pricing will manipulate during the work. Consider declining.

**What you don't have to do:**
- Justify your prices
- Explain your cost structure
- Apologize for charging
- Discount to keep anyone

Your price is your price. It's information, not negotiation.

---

## Field Note: The Client She Lost (And Needed To)

The potential client pushed back. Hard.

"That's a lot of money for what you're offering. I've seen similar services for half that."

The old her would have folded. Discounted. Apologized.

Instead, she said: "I understand. If this isn't the right fit, I'm happy to refer you elsewhere."

The client huffed. "Well, if you were really confident in your work, you'd be flexible."

She recognized it—the manipulation pattern. The diminishment. The entitled demand.

"I wish you well finding what works for you," she said, and ended the call.

It stung. Briefly.

Then she felt something else: pride. She'd held her line. She hadn't collapsed. She hadn't let someone talk her out of her worth.

The next week, a different client signed at full rate without hesitation.

The right people can afford you. The wrong people negotiate you down.

---

## Receiving Payment Gracefully

Charging is step one. Receiving is step two. Many struggle with both.

**What blocked receiving looks like:**
- Apologizing when sending invoices
- Not following up on late payments
- Feeling guilty when paid
- Immediately offering more to "deserve" what you were paid
- Discomfort with the money actually arriving

**What healthy receiving looks like:**
- Sending invoices without apology
- Following up on late payments promptly
- Accepting payment as fair exchange
- Letting the transaction be complete
- Actually enjoying the income

**The practice:** When payment arrives, pause. Let yourself feel it. Say (even just to yourself): "I receive this." Let the body register: *receiving is safe.*

---

## A Practice: The Worthiness Audit

Examine your beliefs about money and worth.

**Complete these sentences honestly:**

"I can't charge more because..."
"If I raised my rates, people would think..."
"Money means..."
"Receiving money makes me feel..."
"I'm worth [X amount] because..."
"Asking for money is..."

**Then examine each answer:**
- Where did this belief come from?
- Is it still true?
- Who taught me this?
- What would I believe if I hadn't experienced what I experienced?

These beliefs aren't fixed. They can be rewritten. Seeing them clearly is the first step.

---

## A Practice: The Receiving Practice

Train the nervous system to receive.

**Daily practice:**
When anything positive comes—a compliment, help offered, payment received, gift given—pause before responding.

**Step 1:** Notice the deflection impulse.
The urge to diminish, refuse, or immediately reciprocate.

**Step 2:** Don't act on it.
Just notice it. Let it be there without obeying it.

**Step 3:** Breathe into receiving.
Imagine the positive thing landing. Let your body take it in.

**Step 4:** Simple acknowledgment.
"Thank you." Nothing more needed.

**Step 5:** Notice what happens in your body.
Expansion? Contraction? Discomfort? Just data.

**Over time,** receiving becomes less charged. The nervous system learns: *I can take things in without danger.*

---

## The Gap Between Earning and Receiving

Some people can earn but can't receive.

**Signs of the gap:**
- Make good money but always feel poor
- Can't spend on yourself what you'd spend on others
- Guilt about having while others don't
- Can't enjoy what you've earned
- Money comes in and immediately goes out on others

**What's happening:** You've learned to produce but not to have. Earning is active—it's doing. Receiving is passive—it requires letting.

**The work:** Not just earning more. Receiving what you earn. Letting yourself have what you've generated.

---

## Receiving and Safety

Ultimately, receiving is a question of safety.

**When receiving is unsafe:**
- Others controlled what you got
- Receiving meant obligation
- Having triggered envy or attack
- Resources could be taken at any moment
- Receiving meant visibility

**When receiving becomes safe:**
- You control your resources
- Receiving is exchange, not debt
- Having is allowed
- Resources are protected
- Receiving is private if you want

**The shift:** As you build actual safety—financial boundaries, your own accounts, legal protections—the nervous system can update. Receiving in the new context can become safe in a way it wasn't before.

---

## Guilt About Earning "Too Much"

Some trauma survivors who do heal their receiving face a new challenge: guilt about success.

**This shows up as:**
- Earning well but feeling bad about it
- Comparing income to others and feeling shame
- Donating or spending to get rid of money that feels "too much"
- Keeping success small to avoid guilt
- Feeling like a bad person for thriving

**What's underneath:**
- Survivor's guilt (others are still struggling)
- Internalized messages that wealth is bad
- Fear that success means losing yourself
- Confusion between earning and deserving

**The reframe:** Your prosperity doesn't harm others. In most cases, your thriving enables more generosity, more contribution, more impact. Keeping yourself small doesn't help anyone.

## Field Note: The Woman Who Let Herself Have

For years after the divorce, she lived minimally.

Not from necessity—her business was doing well. But from some leftover belief that she didn't deserve more than the basics.

One day, a friend asked: "Why don't you ever spend money on yourself?"

She didn't have a good answer. The money was there. The need was there. But something stopped her.

In therapy, she realized: in the marriage, spending on herself was criticized. Treated as selfish. Any pleasure she took was later weaponized.

She'd learned: *I can have, but I shouldn't enjoy. I can earn, but I shouldn't receive.*

The practice was simple but hard: spend on herself without guilt. Buy something she wanted, not just needed. Let herself have.

The first purchase—a piece of art for her wall—she almost returned three times.

She kept it. It's still there.

It reminds her daily: *I'm allowed to have.*

## The Role of Generosity

A note on generosity and pricing:

You can be generous without underpricing.

**Healthy generosity:**
- Offering scholarships at full rate while maintaining premium pricing
- Giving freely in content while charging for intensive work
- Volunteering time and expertise in contexts you choose
- Contributing to causes from overflow, not depletion

**Unhealthy generosity (that's actually fear):**
- Underpricing for everyone because you're afraid to charge
- Giving so much away there's nothing left for you
- Calling discount desperation "generosity"
- Burning out in service that no one asked for

True generosity comes from fullness. If you're depleted, you're not being generous—you're sacrificing. And sacrifice from trauma isn't a gift; it's a wound acting out.

## Neuroscience Lens: Rewiring the Money Response

Money triggers are stored in the body.

**Common money triggers:**
- Numbers above a certain threshold activate fear
- Conversations about money elevate heart rate
- Invoicing feels dangerous
- Receiving payment causes contraction

**How to rewire:**

**Exposure with regulation.** Engage with money while staying regulated. Practice naming prices in a grounded state. Invoice with your feet on the floor.

**Positive association.** Pair money moments with safety cues. Deep breathing while checking accounts. Pleasant environments while discussing rates.

**Completion.** After money stress, complete the cycle. Movement. Breath. Regulation. Don't leave the activation lodged in the body.

**Celebration.** When money arrives, let it be good news. Don't minimize. Let the brain register: *income = positive.*

---

## A Practice: Pricing Without Flinching

Before your next pricing conversation:

**Step 1:** Decide your price. Write it down. This is the number.

**Step 2:** Say it out loud. Alone. Repeatedly. Until you can say it without your voice wobbling.

**Step 3:** Practice the silence. Say the price, then stop. Let the silence exist for 10 seconds. This is the hardest part.

**Step 4:** Ground your body. Feet on floor. Slow breath. When you say the price in real time, you'll need this anchor.

**Step 5:** Commit to no discounting. Not in this conversation. If they can't afford it, they're not your client. That's information, not rejection.

**Step 6:** Debrief afterward. What happened in your body? Did you hold your line? What do you want to do differently next time?

---

## What Changes When You Price and Receive Properly

The effects ripple outward:

**Business health:** Sustainable revenue. Capacity to reinvest. Margin for growth.

**Client quality:** Those who value what you offer attract. Those who don't, filter out.

**Your energy:** No more depletion from over-giving. Sustainable capacity.

**Self-worth:** Every time you charge appropriately and receive, you reinforce: *I am worth this.*

**Generosity capacity:** From a position of fullness, you can give freely—because you're not running on empty.

**The cycle becomes positive:** Charge well → serve well → receive well → have capacity → charge well.

It starts with a decision: your work is worth something, and you're willing to receive the exchange.

## Reader Reflection

- What's my primary money wound: worthiness, receiving, visibility, or scarcity?
- What do I believe about charging for my work?
- What happens in my body when I name my price?
- What happens when I receive payment?
- What would change if I truly believed my work was worth what I charge?
- What's one step I can take toward healthier pricing and receiving?

**Body cue to notice:** Contraction or expansion when money arrives; the discount impulse when pricing

**Practice:** Worthiness Audit, Receiving Practice, or Pricing Without Flinching

---

## Integration Line

> *"I can charge what I'm worth because I am worth it. I can receive because receiving is safe now."*

---

## Closing Note for This Chapter

Money isn't just practical. It's deeply personal.

The way you price. The way you charge. The way you receive.

All of it reflects what you believe about your worth, your safety, and your right to have.

The relationship taught you that your worth was questionable. That receiving was dangerous. That money was control.

Those lessons were for a context that no longer exists.

Now, you get to learn something different.

That your work has value. That naming that value is honoring yourself. That receiving payment is a fair exchange, not a dangerous vulnerability.

This isn't about greed or exploitation. It's about fairness. About reciprocity. About building something sustainable.

You give something of value. You receive something in return.

That's how thriving works.

And you are allowed to thrive.
