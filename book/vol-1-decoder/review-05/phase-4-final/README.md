**Status:** ⏳ READY FOR REVIEW
**Date Started:** January 7, 2026
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1-3 Complete ✅

---

## Overview

Phase 4 is the final quality gate before implementing Round 5 changes. This phase verifies that all structural changes, new content, and formatting decisions maintain manuscript integrity.

**Phase 4 Reviewers:**
- **Petra (Proofreader)** - Error detection across all changed content
- **Coherence Analysis** - Structural integrity verification

---

## Scope of Review

### Changes from Phase 1 (Strategic Decisions)
- Format expansion planning (audio, workbook, multi-format Decoder Cards)
- Content expansion scope (52 cards, Module 6, all contexts)
- Structural refinement (4-step protocol, 15-minute highlights)

### Changes from Phase 2 (Content & Experience)

**Bailey (25 questions):**
- Module 2 restructuring with scenario breaks
- Author's personal story in Lesson 1.1
- Module 6 creation from expanded 4.4
- Split lessons: 3.1a/3.1b, 5.4/5.5, bridge lesson 1.5
- 4-step Decoder Protocol (Notice → Pause → Decode → Respond)
- Male examples including "baby trap" scenario
- Reader Reflection boxes and Quick Read summaries

**Sage (22 questions):**
- Same-sex relationship examples
- Gender-neutral framing for reproductive coercion
- Single-parent and extended family dynamics
- Socioeconomic diversity in examples
- Religious/spiritual context section
- Digital manipulation tactics and decoder cards
- Neurodivergent-friendly pattern checklists
- Content warnings and grounding reminders

**Felix (15 questions):**
- 38 vs 37 tactics clarification in Lesson 4.1
- Citations: Walker, Stanford, Carnes, Strutzenberg, LeDoux, Dunbar
- Language qualifications ("one of the most powerful", footnotes)
- Hotline verification (safety critical)
- Duration recalculation for new structure

### Changes from Phase 3 (Polish)

**Lydia (18 questions):**
- Voice consistency for new content (author's story, male examples, Module 6)
- Rhythm and pacing for split lessons and scenario breaks
- Emotional calibration (content warnings, hope language, agency caveats)

**Clara (15 questions):**
- Terminology standardization (52 cards, 6 modules, 4-step protocol)
- Formatting consistency (lesson template, card format, box types)
- Structural updates (lesson numbering with suffixes, cross-references)
- Curriculum complete rewrite
