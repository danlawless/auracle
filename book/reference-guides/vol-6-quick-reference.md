## Why Trauma Survivors Become Helpers

Common drivers:

| Driver | What It Looks Like | Check Yourself |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Meaning-making** | "My pain can help others" | Healthy if not compulsive |
| **Redemption** | "I'll give what I never received" | Healthy if you've also received it |
| **Control** | "Helping keeps me safe" | Shadow territory |
| **Identity** | "I am the helper" | Shadow territory |
| **Avoidance** | "Focus on them, not me" | Shadow territory |

**The call to help is real. The shadow of helping is also real.**

---

## When Helping Is Hiding

| Helping | Hiding |
|---------|--------|
| Serving from overflow | Serving to feel valuable |
| Boundaried presence | Losing yourself in others |
| Sustainable giving | Depleting giving |
| Identity beyond helping | Identity dependent on being needed |
| Can receive as well as give | Only comfortable giving |

**Ask:** "If I could never help anyone again, would I still feel valuable?"

---

## The Rescuer's Trap

| Pattern | What's Happening |
|---------|------------------|
| "I can save them" | Over-functioning for their growth |
| "They need me" | Creating dependency |
| "Only I understand" | Positioning as indispensable |
| "I can't say no" | Boundaries feel like abandonment |
| "I'll give one more thing" | Depletion as love |

**You cannot want their healing more than they do.**

---

## Vicarious Trauma vs. Compassion Fatigue

| Vicarious Trauma | Compassion Fatigue |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Taking on others' trauma material | Exhaustion from caring too much |
| Their nightmares become yours | Numbness or withdrawal |
| Worldview shifts | Cynicism or hopelessness |
| Changes your nervous system | Depletes your capacity |
| Needs processing | Needs rest and boundaries |

**Both are occupational hazards of care work. Both require attention.**

---

## Signs You're Over-Giving

- You dread sessions/interactions you once loved
- You think about clients/people constantly
- You feel responsible for their outcomes
- You break your own boundaries "just this once" (repeatedly)
- You can't stop even when exhausted
- Your own life is suffering
- You give advice you don't take yourself

---

## Scope of Practice: Know Your Lane

| You Can Offer | You Cannot Offer (Unless Trained) |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| Lived experience | Diagnosis |
| Personal practices that helped | Medical/psychiatric advice |
| Resources and referrals | Treatment plans |
| Witness and validation | Therapy interventions |
| General guidance | Clinical assessment |

**Stay in your lane. Refer when needed. It's not abandonment—it's integrity.**

---

## The Ethics of Lived Experience

| Ethical Practice | Watch Out For |
|------------------|---------------|
| "This is what helped me" | "You should do what I did" |
| Sharing your story when relevant | Making it about you |
| Acknowledging you're not a therapist | Practicing therapy without license |
| Referring to professionals | Keeping people dependent |
| Charging fairly for your time | Exploiting vulnerable people |

---

## When to Refer

Refer when:
- Issues exceed your training
- You're losing objectivity
- Dual relationship complications arise
- Clinical symptoms appear (suicide, psychosis, etc.)
- You're the wrong fit
- You're triggered by their material
- They need more than you can provide

**How to refer:** "I think you'd benefit from someone who specializes in [X]. I can help you find someone. This isn't goodbye—it's getting you what you need."

---

## Session Hygiene Protocol

**Before:**
- Clear your energy (breath, movement, intention)
- Ground yourself (feet on floor, present to body)
- Set intention (service, not rescue)

**During:**
- Notice your body signals
- Maintain your boundary (their material ≠ yours)
- Don't overwork
- Trust the process

**After:**
- Clear what's not yours (shake, move, breathe)
- Transition ritual (walk, water, fresh air)
- Debrief if needed (supervision, peer support)
- Return to your life

---

## Boundaried Presence

| Over-Involved | Under-Involved | Boundaried |
|---------------|----------------|------------|
| Feeling their feelings | Cold and distant | Present but separate |
| Losing yourself | Protecting yourself | Offering yourself |
| Over-functioning | Under-functioning | Right-sized offering |
| Exhausted | Disconnected | Sustained |

**Boundaried presence = I am fully here AND I am fully me.**

---

## Caseload and Capacity

**Calculate your actual capacity:**
- How many deep conversations can you hold per day?
- How much recovery time do you need between them?
- What's your threshold before depletion?

**Then:** Set your caseload BELOW that threshold. Leave margin.

**The math:**
- Full capacity = eventual burnout
- Below capacity = sustainable service

---

## Supervision and Support

Even if you're not a licensed professional:

| What You Need | Why It Matters |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Peer support** | Others who understand the work |
| **Mentorship** | Someone further along the path |
| **Therapy** | Your own work alongside helping others |
| **Community** | People who know you beyond your role |
| **Rest** | Non-negotiable recovery time |

**The helper who doesn't get help eventually harms.**

---

## Content Creation as Service

| Service | Performance |
|---------|-------------|
| "This might help someone" | "Look how healed I am" |
| Sharing what's processed | Sharing what's raw for engagement |
| Clear boundaries on vulnerability | Over-disclosure for connection |
| Speaks to the work | Speaks to the follower count |

**Ask:** "Am I sharing this because it serves them, or because I need to be seen?"

---

## Building Community, Not Dependency

| Dependency | Empowerment |
|------------|-------------|
| "You need me" | "You have what you need" |
| Answers | Questions that lead to their answers |
| Connection to you | Connection to themselves |
| Your authority | Their authority |
| Long-term need | Growing independence |

**The goal is making yourself unnecessary.**

---

## The Business of Helping

| Truth | Practice |
|-------|----------|
| Your time has value | Charge appropriately |
| Free work depletes | Sustainable models required |
| Money and service coexist | Clear about exchange |
| Undercharging is shadow | Price reflects value |

**You cannot pour from an empty cup. Financial sustainability matters.**

---
