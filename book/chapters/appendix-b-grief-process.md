# Appendix B: The Grief Process After Leaving

## Navigating the Waves of Loss

---

When you leave a narcissistic relationship or transform your relationship with a narcissistic family member, you will grieve.

This surprises many people. "Why am I grieving someone who hurt me? Does this mean I made the wrong choice?"

No. It means you're human. And grief is more complex than we often acknowledge.

---

## What You're Grieving

You're not grieving one thing. You're grieving many:

### The Relationship You Hoped It Would Be

You didn't stay because you loved the abuse. You stayed because you loved who they were sometimes, or who you believed they could become. You're grieving the version that was never going to materialize.

### The Good Times

They were real. Amid the manipulation, there were moments of genuine connection, laughter, joy. The existence of these moments doesn't erase the harm—but their loss is still loss.

### The Future You Imagined

Wedding plans, children, retirement together, holidays with extended family—whatever future you had envisioned now won't happen. Even if that future was largely fantasy, its loss is real.

### The Family You Deserved

If this is family narcissism, you're grieving the parents, siblings, or childhood you should have had. This is not self-pity; it's honest acknowledgment of a real deprivation.

### Your Former Self

The person you were before the relationship—innocent of these patterns, trusting, open—is gone. You may mourn that version of yourself even as you appreciate who you've become.

### The Time Lost

Months, years, decades given to someone who couldn't reciprocate. Time you'll never get back. It's fair to grieve this.

### The Dream of Being Loved by Them

Perhaps the deepest grief: releasing the hope that this particular person—parent, partner, friend—would ever love you the way you needed. This acceptance is profound and painful.

## The Waves of Grief

Grief doesn't move in a straight line. It comes in waves.

### Phase 1: Relief and Triumph

**Timing:** Often immediate after leaving or going no contact.

**What it feels like:** Freedom. Lightness. "I did it." The weight lifts. You can breathe for the first time in a long time. Sometimes even joy and a sense of victory—you finally broke free.

**What to know:** This is real and valid. Enjoy it. It's also not the whole picture—more will come.

> *"I felt relief and joy at first, and triumph. Then guilt, as if it's my decision and fault that I caused it. Then grief."* — This exact sequence is incredibly common. The relief is real, the guilt is conditioned, and the grief is healthy. All of it belongs.

### Phase 2: Guilt

**Timing:** Often follows shortly after relief.

**What it feels like:** "Did I cause this? Was I too harsh? Should I have tried harder? Am I abandoning them?"

**What to know:** Guilt is often installed by the narcissist. It doesn't mean you did anything wrong. Question where the guilt came from and whose voice it sounds like.

### Phase 3: Grief

**Timing:** Can come soon after or much later; may arrive unexpectedly.

**What it feels like:** Sadness. Missing them. Missing the good parts. Crying. Heavy heart. Sometimes feeling the full weight of all you've lost.

**What to know:** This is healthy. You're processing the loss. Let it move through. Suppressing it only delays it.

### Phase 4: Anger

**Timing:** Can come before, during, or after grief; often returns in waves.

**What it feels like:** Rage at what they did. Fury at the injustice. Anger at yourself for staying. Sometimes anger at everyone who didn't see or help.

**What to know:** Anger is appropriate. It means you're valuing yourself. Let it be felt, but channel it consciously so it doesn't consume you.

### Phase 5: Confusion and Doubt

**Timing:** Often comes when the acute intensity calms.

**What it feels like:** "Was it really that bad? Maybe I exaggerated. Maybe I should go back and try again."

**What to know:** This is normal, especially if you've been gaslit. Return to your reality anchors—journal entries, trusted friends' perspectives, specific memories of harm.

### Phase 6: Integration

**Timing:** Gradual; may take months or years.

**What it feels like:** The experience becomes part of your story without defining you. You can hold the complexity—the harm AND the humanity. You're neither consumed by nor avoiding what happened.

**What to know:** This is where you're heading. It doesn't mean you'll never feel the other phases again, but their intensity and duration decrease.

## These Phases Don't Move in Order

You may feel relief, then grief, then relief again, then anger, then more grief.

You may feel grief and anger simultaneously.

You may circle back to guilt six months later when they post something on social media that triggers you.

This is normal. Grief isn't linear. The key is not to get stuck—to let each wave move through rather than resisting it or drowning in it.

## Missing Someone Who Hurt You

This is the most confusing part for many people. How can you miss someone who caused so much harm?

### Remember: You're Missing Multiple Things

- The good parts of them (which were real)
- The relief after conflict (which felt like love)
- Having someone there (even if they were harmful)
- The familiarity (even if it was dysfunctional)
- The fantasy of who they could have been

### This Doesn't Mean You Should Go Back

Missing someone isn't a command. It's a feeling. You can feel it fully without acting on it.

Think of it like missing a drug. The craving is real, intense, physiological. That doesn't mean the drug is good for you. It means your brain was wired to need it.

### What Helps

- Let yourself miss them without judgment
- Remind yourself what you're actually missing (often the fantasy)
- Stay connected to reality anchors
- Fill the space with safe connections
- Trust that the missing will diminish with time and distance

## Grief Rituals

Rituals help grief move. Consider:

### Writing a Letter You Won't Send

Pour everything out. The love. The rage. The grief. The hope that died. Write until you're empty.

Then: burn it, bury it, release it to water, or simply delete it.

### Creating a Symbolic Ending

- Remove all their belongings from your space
- Delete photos (or archive them somewhere you won't see)
- Change something physical (haircut, room arrangement, new routine)
- Create a small ceremony for yourself marking the ending

### Memory Box or Bonfire

Gather physical objects connected to the relationship.

Either: Put them in a box, seal it, and put it away. You're not erasing the past; you're containing it.

Or: Safely burn what can be burned. Release the energy held in these objects.

### Day of Mourning

Set aside a day specifically to grieve. Let yourself cry, rage, journal, sleep, watch sad movies—whatever your body needs. Give grief its space.

### Marking the Anniversary

One year after leaving, acknowledge what you survived. Celebrate how far you've come. Honor the grief that remains. This can become an annual practice of witnessing your own journey.

## When Grief Gets Stuck

Sometimes grief doesn't move naturally. Signs it may be stuck:

- Persistent depression that doesn't lift
- Unable to function months after the ending
- Intrusive thoughts or flashbacks that worsen
- Self-harm or suicidal ideation
- Using substances to avoid feeling
- Complete inability to feel anything (numbing)

If you recognize these patterns, please seek professional help. A therapist trained in trauma can help grief complete its process safely.

## Self-Compassion in Grief

Be gentle with yourself during this time:

- You don't have to be "over it" by any deadline
- Some days will be worse than others
- Crying doesn't mean you're regressing
- Missing them doesn't mean you should go back
- Anger doesn't mean you're a bad person
- Confusion doesn't mean you made the wrong choice

This is one of the hardest things humans do—grieve a relationship that harmed us. Give yourself the compassion you would give a dear friend in the same situation.

---

## The Grief Doesn't Mean You're Wrong

This is worth repeating:

**The fact that you grieve does not mean you made the wrong choice.**

You can grieve and still know leaving was right.
You can miss them and still refuse to go back.
You can wish it had been different and still accept that it wasn't.

Grief is a response to loss. You experienced loss—of a relationship, of a fantasy, of years, of trust. Grief is the appropriate response, regardless of who caused the loss.

---

## What Emerges After Grief

On the other side of processed grief, you'll find:

- **Clarity:** A clear-eyed view of what happened
- **Wisdom:** Lessons that will serve you for life
- **Freedom:** No longer bound by hope or attachment
- **Space:** Room for new relationships and experiences
- **Peace:** Acceptance of what was and what is
- **Self-trust:** Knowing you can survive difficult endings

Grief is the passage to these gifts. It's not a detour from healing—it is the healing.

---

## Final Thought

You may feel pressure to "move on," from yourself or others. But grief has its own timeline.

What you're grieving is real. How long you need is how long you need.

Be patient with yourself. The waves will become gentler. The grief will complete. And you'll carry what you've learned into everything that comes next.

## Practical Grief Tools

### The 15-Minute Grief Window

Structure grief so it doesn't consume you:

1. **Set a timer for 15 minutes**
2. **During this time:** Allow full grief. Cry. Write. Remember. Feel it completely.
3. **When timer ends:** Deliberately shift. Wash face. Walk around. Change activity.
4. **Repeat as needed:** You can do multiple windows per day if needed.

This contains grief without suppressing it. You're not avoiding—you're titrating.

### The Goodbye Letter Protocol

Write separate goodbye letters to:

**1. The person they pretended to be:** The charming, loving version. The potential you fell for.

**2. The person they actually were:** The pattern. The harm. The reality.

**3. The future you imagined:** The dreams that won't happen. The life you planned.

**4. Your former self:** The version of you before this. The innocence lost.

Write each fully. Then choose what to do with them—burn, bury, save, or simply close the document. The writing is the work.

### The Grief vs. Trauma Distinction

**Grief feels like:**
- Waves of sadness
- Missing what was
- Acceptance gradually emerging
- Tears that eventually complete

**Trauma activation feels like:**
- Panic, freeze, or fight/flight
- Flashbacks and intrusive memories
- Unable to function
- Stuck in a loop that doesn't resolve

If you're experiencing the second list consistently, you may need trauma-specific support (EMDR, somatic therapy) in addition to grief processing.

### The Anniversary Protocol

First anniversary of leaving (or any significant date):

**Before:**
- Plan something meaningful for yourself
- Arrange support (don't be alone if you don't want to be)
- Lower expectations for productivity

**During:**
- Acknowledge the day consciously
- Allow whatever feelings arise
- Do something honoring your survival
- Connect with someone who understands

**After:**
- Reflect on how far you've come
- Document what's different now
- Set intention for the year ahead

Anniversaries can be tender. Plan for them instead of being ambushed.

*Grief is love with nowhere to go. Let it flow through you until it finds its way home.*
