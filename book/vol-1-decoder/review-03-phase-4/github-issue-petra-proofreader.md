# GitHub Issue: Petra (Proofreader) - Phase 4 Final Pass

**Title:** `[Review Round 3 - Phase 4] Petra (Proofreader): 5 Final Questions - Vol. 1`

**Labels:** `review-round-3`, `phase-4-final`, `author-input-required`

**Repository:** danlawless/auracle

## Overview

Hi! I'm Petra, the Proofreader. This is Phase 4 (Final Pass) of Review Round 3 for Volume 1: The Narcissism Decoder.

**Why Phase 4 is LAST:** Proofreading must be the final editorial step. Any content changes after proofreading could introduce new errors. All structural (Phase 1), content (Phase 2), and polish (Phase 3) decisions must be complete before this phase.

## Direct Corrections (No Decision Needed)

These corrections can be applied immediately based on established style sheet rules:

### Correction 1: Front Matter Hotline Number

**Location:** `00-front-matter.md`, Line 25

| Current | Change to |
|---------|-----------|
| `1-800-799-7233 (24/7)` | `1-800-799-7233` |

**Reason:** Style sheet indicates hotline numbers should not have parenthetical descriptors.

---

### Correction 2: Chapter 13 Hotline Number

**Location:** `chapters/13-exposure-questions.md`, Line 16

| Current | Change to |
|---------|-----------|
| `1-800-799-7233 (24/7)` | `1-800-799-7233` |

**Reason:** Same style consistency as Correction 1.

---

### Correction 3: README Chapter Title

**Location:** `README.md`, Line 93

| Current | Change to |
|---------|-----------|
| `Chapter 13: Diagnostic Questions` | `Chapter 13: The Exposure Questions` |

**Reason:** Actual chapter title is "The Exposure Questions." README uses outdated title.

---

## Questions for Author (5 Questions)

### Q1: Chapter 5 Redundant Subtitle

**Location:** `chapters/05-narcissist-types.md`, Lines 1-2

**Current:**
```markdown
# Chapter 5: Understanding Narcissist Types

## Understanding the Different Faces of Narcissism
```

Both the title and subtitle use "Understanding" and refer to the same concept.

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Repetition is intentional for rhythm/emphasis — keep as-is
- [ ] B) Change subtitle to "The Different Faces of Narcissism" (remove "Understanding")
- [ ] C) Change subtitle to different concept (e.g., "The Spectrum from Grandiose to Covert")
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

**Why this matters:** Subtitle redundancy can feel accidental rather than intentional to readers.

### Q2: Hotline Number Formatting Consistency

**Current practice varies across locations:**

| Location | Format |
|----------|--------|
| Front matter line 25 | `1-800-799-7233 (24/7)` |
| Chapter 13 line 16 | `1-800-799-7233 (24/7)` |
| Appendix A line 19 | `1-800-799-7233 (TTY: 1-800-787-3224)` |
| README line 50 | `1-800-799-7233 (24/7, confidential)` |

**Question:** Should the manuscript adopt a single consistent format?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Remove all parenthetical descriptors (cleanest, most consistent)
- [ ] B) Include TTY numbers where relevant but remove time/availability descriptors
- [ ] C) Keep variation as intentional by context
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

---

### Q3: Crisis Resource Formatting Variations

Crisis resources appear in different formats:

1. **Front matter:** Simple bullet list
2. **Chapter 13:** Table format with safety level descriptions
3. **Appendix A:** Comprehensive table with TTY and international resources
4. **README:** Simple list format

**Question:** Are these intentional variations based on context?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Intentional variation by location — keep as-is
- [ ] B) Standardize to simple list format throughout
- [ ] C) Standardize to table format throughout
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

---

### Q4: Em Dash Spacing in Appendix C

**Status check:** Round 2 identified "12 instances" of spaced em dashes in Appendix C. Current Round 3 review found **zero** instances — all em dashes appear correctly formatted.

**Question:** Was this issue already corrected between Round 2 and Round 3?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Yes, already corrected — no action needed
- [ ] B) Not corrected — provide specific line numbers
- [ ] C) Other: _____________

---

### Q5: Publication Readiness Confirmation

**Question:** Are there any known issues or planned changes that should be addressed before final publication?
