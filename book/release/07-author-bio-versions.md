Jennifer Brooke Lawless holds degrees in Psychology (Boston University) and Mental Health Counseling (Nova Southeastern University).

## Medium Bio (150 words)

*For: Gumroad, Substack, guest post bylines*

Jennifer Brooke Lawless is a mental health counselor, writer, and survivor of narcissistic abuse. She holds a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from Boston University and a Master of Science in Mental Health Counseling from Nova Southeastern University, with clinical experience spanning psychiatric care, family systems therapy, and couples work.

Her healing journey led her beyond traditional therapy—through shadow work, nervous system regulation, and the slow practice of building secure attachment from the inside out. She discovered that naming patterns isn't enough; the body needs to learn something new.

Today, Jennifer lives in Costa Rica surrounded by community, where she offers aura readings, integration sessions, and spiritual guidance through Light Field Institute. Her books—*The Narcissism Decoder*, *The Bridge*, and *Sovereignty*—were written for the person she used to be: confused, self-doubting, and desperately needing someone to explain what was happening.
