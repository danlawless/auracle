# Appendix E: Reader Self-Check

## Sexuality, Safety & the Nervous System

---

This is not a test. This is a mirror.

Answer slowly. Skip anything that feels activating. Return when ready.

---

## Early Learning & Environment

Check any that resonate:

- ☐ I was exposed to adult sexuality without explanation or protection
- ☐ Sexual jokes, material, or behavior made me uncomfortable growing up
- ☐ I witnessed infidelity, humiliation, or desperation around relationships
- ☐ I learned more by watching adults than by being taught
- ☐ Boundaries around sexuality felt unclear or absent

**If several resonate:** Your body learned about sex before it learned about safety.

---

## Consent & Choice

- ☐ I've agreed to sexual situations to keep the peace
- ☐ I've said "okay" when I felt frozen or unsure
- ☐ I've felt relief after sex rather than connection
- ☐ I've struggled to leave situations that felt uncomfortable
- ☐ I've gone along with things I didn't want

**If several resonate:** This reflects survival intelligence, not weak boundaries.

---

## Arousal Patterns

- ☐ Desire increases during conflict or intensity
- ☐ Calm or safety sometimes reduces libido
- ☐ I confuse chemistry with compatibility
- ☐ I've been aroused without feeling emotionally present
- ☐ Tenderness feels flat compared to intensity

**If several resonate:** Arousal can be conditioned. Desire requires safety.

---

## During Intimacy

- ☐ I dissociate or feel "not fully there" during sex
- ☐ I perform instead of feel
- ☐ I struggle to stay embodied
- ☐ I feel pressure to give or please
- ☐ I watch myself from the outside

**If several resonate:** Dissociation is a protective reflex, not disinterest.

---

## After Intimacy

- ☐ I feel shame without knowing why
- ☐ I replay interactions mentally
- ☐ I feel empty or depleted
- ☐ I wonder what's "wrong" with me
- ☐ Connection fades quickly after sex

**If several resonate:** Shame often belongs to unmet safety needs, not to you.

---

## Relational Themes

- ☐ I fear disappointing partners sexually
- ☐ I struggle to say no without guilt
- ☐ I've used sex to repair conflict
- ☐ I feel more desired than cherished
- ☐ My partner has complained about disconnection

**If several resonate:** Sex can become a repair strategy when repair wasn't modeled.

---

## Reclamation Signals

Check any that are emerging:

- ☐ I'm noticing my body's yes/no more clearly
- ☐ I pause instead of override myself
- ☐ I can feel arousal without acting on it
- ☐ Desire is quieter—but feels more honest
- ☐ I'm less willing to perform
- ☐ I'm more interested in presence than intensity

**If several resonate:** These are signs of recalibration, not loss.

## Interpreting Your Checkmarks

### Many checks in early sections (Early Learning, Consent):

Your sexuality likely organized around survival. This is not your fault—your body adapted to what was available.

### Many checks in arousal & intimacy sections:

Your nervous system may still associate intensity with connection. This is rewirable.

### Checks in reclamation section:

Healing is already underway. Trust the process.

---

## One-Line Reframe

*My sexuality adapted to keep me safe. Now it is learning how to feel free.*

---

## Optional Reflection Prompts

Use these for journaling or quiet reflection:

1. **Where did I learn to override myself?**
   What early experience taught me that my signals don't matter?

2. **What does my body need before desire can return?**
   Safety? Time? Trust? Honesty? Something else?

3. **What would safety feel like during intimacy?**
   Not what it "should" look like—what would it actually feel like in your body?

4. **What happens if I don't rush myself?**
   What fears arise when I consider taking more time?

5. **What would sexuality feel like if it weren't managing anything?**
   If it didn't have to regulate fear, secure attachment, or prove worth?

## Reader Note

If parts of this checklist stirred emotion, pause. Ground. Breathe.

Nothing here requires fixing today.

Awareness is progress.

---

## The Core Truth

None of these patterns mean you are broken.

They mean your body learned early—and is now learning again.

**What was learned in chaos can be unlearned in safety—slowly, gently, and without force.**

---

## Integration Statement

*Your nervous system did what it was trained to do. Healing teaches it something new.*

---

*Return to this self-check periodically. Notice what shifts.*
