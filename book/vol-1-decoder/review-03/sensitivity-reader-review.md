**Reviewer:** Sage (The Witness) - Sensitivity Reader
**Date:** January 4, 2026
**Scope:** Full manuscript review including 19 chapters, front matter, back matter, 5 appendices, plus analysis of Rounds 1 & 2 sensitivity reviews
**Round:** 3

---

## Executive Summary

This Round 3 sensitivity review comes from the perspective of **Sage, the Sensitivity Reader (The Witness)**, whose role is to ensure authentic, respectful representation of marginalized identities, cultures, and experiences in this self-help book about narcissistic abuse.

### Overall Assessment

This manuscript remains **strong, compassionate, trauma-informed work** that demonstrates genuine care for survivors. The author has made meaningful improvements since Round 1, particularly in:
- Adding LGBTQ+ representation (Chapter 11)
- Expanding international resources (Appendix A)
- Including disability resources (Appendix A - newly added)
- Adding notes about terminology (Chapter 8's parental wound framing)

However, significant gaps persist that warrant the author's thoughtful consideration. Rather than prescribing solutions, this review poses **questions to help the author explore how their work lands with diverse survivor communities.**

### Core Strengths to Preserve

1. **Survivor-Centered Agency** - Never victim-blames; consistently validates survivor experience
2. **Trauma-Informed Throughout** - Uses neuroscience to destigmatize responses
3. **Body-Based Wisdom** - Centers somatic knowing and nervous system literacy
4. **Practical Tools** - Provides concrete scripts, protocols, and grounding techniques
5. **Safety Resources** - Crisis information prominently placed and repeated
6. **Archetype Framework** - Protects privacy while teaching universal patterns
7. **Permission-Giving Tone** - Explicitly grants survivors permission to trust themselves

### Primary Questions This Review Raises

This Round 3 review focuses on generating **questions for the author** rather than prescriptive fixes. The goal is to help the author consider:

1. How might readers from different cultural backgrounds interpret advice that assumes Western individualism?
2. How can we ensure body-based practices are accessible to disabled and neurodivergent readers?
3. What unintended messages might economic privilege in the author bio send to readers without resources?
4. How might certain field notes be weaponized in contexts like custody battles?
5. What's the author's intent around balancing accessible language with avoiding stigma toward people with NPD who are seeking treatment?

## Context: Progress Since Previous Rounds

### What Has Improved

**Round 1 → Round 2 → Round 3 Progress:**

| Area | Round 1 Status | Round 2 Status | Round 3 Status |
|------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| LGBTQ+ Representation | Missing | **Improved** - Ch. 11 section added | Maintained |
| International Resources | US-only | **Improved** - 7 countries | **Further Improved** - Expanded significantly |
| Disability Resources | Absent | Absent | **NEW** - Section added in Appendix A |
| Gender-Neutral Examples | Rare | Rare | Still limited but note added |
| Cultural Context Disclaimer | Missing | Missing | **Partially Added** - Ch. 8 note |

### Critical Issues Still Unaddressed from Rounds 1 & 2

1. **Safety Warning Placement** (Ch. 13, 17) - Still appears mid or late in chapters
2. **"Mother Wound/Father Wound" Gender Binary** (Ch. 8) - Note added but structure remains
3. **Economic Privilege Unacknowledged** (Author Bio) - No privilege statement
4. **Body Wisdom Absolutism** - Some softening but statements like "default to the body" remain
5. **Cultural Framework Assumptions** - Western individualism still presented as universal

## Round 3 Sensitivity Analysis: Questions for the Author

### Category 1: Survivor Representation & Empowerment

#### Current Strengths
- Excellent survivor agency throughout
- Avoids victim-blaming language
- Validates complexity of staying/leaving
- Provides nuanced understanding of trauma bonds

#### Questions for the Author

**Q1.1: Body Awareness and Trauma Responses**

Chapter 2 centers body awareness as an early warning system. While this is powerful for many survivors, how do you want to address readers whose trauma responses have *disconnected* them from body signals?

Context: The book states "When body and mind disagree, default to the body" (Ch. 2). For survivors with complex trauma, dissociation, or chronic pain conditions, body signals may be:
- Numbed or inaccessible
- Sending false alarms due to PTSD
- Conflicting or confusing
- Overwhelming to tune into

**Question:** How might you acknowledge that learning to trust body signals is itself a healing process, not an immediate ability all survivors have access to?

**Q1.2: The "Too Sensitive" Reclamation**

The book beautifully reframes "too sensitive" as accurate perception being dismissed (Ch. 2, Ch. 10). This is validating for many survivors.

**Question:** How do you want to distinguish between:
- Sensitivity as accurate threat detection (gift)
- Hypervigilance as trauma response (understandable but sometimes needs recalibration)
- Neurodivergent sensory processing differences

Context: Some neurodivergent readers may have been called "too sensitive" about sensory issues (lights, sounds, textures) that aren't related to emotional manipulation. How might the framing acknowledge this?

**Q1.3: "Leaving" as Default Solution**

The book provides excellent support for leaving abusive relationships and acknowledges some barriers (economic, custody, etc.).

**Question:** How might you more explicitly validate readers who cannot leave due to:
- Severe disability requiring caregiver (who may be the abuser)
- Immigration status tied to abuser
- Severe economic dependence with no safety net
- Cultural/religious contexts where leaving has catastrophic consequences
- Being a minor in an abusive family

Would a section on "Surviving While Staying" honor these readers' reality?

### Category 2: Mental Health Terminology & Stigma

#### Current Strengths
- Non-diagnostic approach (focuses on patterns, not diagnosis)
- Distinguishes NPD from narcissistic behaviors
- Acknowledges "codependency" as potentially pathologizing term

#### Questions for the Author

**Q2.1: "Narcissist" as Both Clinical and Colloquial Term**

The book uses "narcissist" and "the narcissist" throughout while stating it's not diagnosing anyone.

**Question:** What's your intent around:
- People with diagnosed NPD who are in treatment and working on change?
- The risk of readers armchair-diagnosing family members/exes?
- The line between describing patterns vs. creating a villain archetype?

Context: Some clinicians worry that popularizing "narcissist" as shorthand for "abusive person" stigmatizes people with NPD (a treatable condition) while missing that many abusers don't have NPD. What's your thinking here?

**Q2.2: Neurodivergence and "Lack of Empathy"**

The book describes narcissists as having "impaired empathy" or "lack of empathy."

**Question:** How do you want to distinguish:
- Narcissistic lack of empathy (present but not activated/valued)
- Autistic differences in empathy expression (present but processed differently)
- Alexithymia (difficulty identifying/describing emotions)

Context: Autistic advocates have raised concerns about "lack of empathy" language conflating autism with harmful intent. How might you clarify you're describing willful disregard, not neurodivergent processing differences?

**Q2.3: Depression and Childhood**

Chapter 10 states "Children become depressed when their environment is depressing" (line 67).

**Question:** How do you want to acknowledge:
- Biological/genetic factors in depression?
- Depression that occurs even in supportive environments?
- The intersection of environmental trauma AND biological vulnerability?

The statement as written is validating but could be read as saying depression is always environmental. Is that your intent?

### Category 3: Gender & Power Dynamics

#### Current Strengths
- Note in Ch. 8 acknowledging terminology limitations
- Varied pronouns in some examples
- LGBTQ+ section in Ch. 11
- Acknowledgment of abuse occurring across all genders

#### Questions for the Author

**Q3.1: "Mother Wound" / "Father Wound" Structure**

Chapter 8 includes an excellent note explaining these terms aren't limited to biological mothers/fathers. However, the chapter structure still separates "Mother Wound" and "Father Wound" with distinct characteristics (nurturing failure vs. achievement pressure).

**Questions:**
- What would be lost by reframing as "Primary Caregiver Wound" and "Secondary Caregiver Wound"?
- How might current structure reinforce stereotypes that mothers = nurturing, fathers = achievement?
- Do you find that these wounds truly align with gender, or with the role/attachment position?

Context: Previous reviews flagged this. Your note helps, but structure may still reinforce gender essentialism.

**Q3.2: Default Gender in Examples**

While the book uses varied pronouns, heterosexual dynamics with gendered power (he/him perpetrator, she/her victim) still dominate examples.

**Question:** Would you consider:
- More examples with female perpetrators?
- More examples with they/them perpetrators or victims?
- Same-gender relationship examples integrated throughout (not just in one section)?

Context: Even with the disclaimer, pattern recognition is stronger when readers see themselves in examples. How many examples need to reflect diverse scenarios for meaningful inclusion?

**Q3.3: Field Note - "The Makeup Sex Trophy" (Ch. 4)**

This field note powerfully illustrates sexual objectification post-conflict using a heterosexual scenario where "he" brags to friends about "she came around."

**Question:** How do power dynamics and sexual objectification manifest differently in:
- Relationships with female perpetrators?
- Same-gender relationships?
- Relationships involving non-binary individuals?

Would including varied scenarios strengthen the teaching, or would it dilute the impact of the specific pattern?

### Category 4: Cultural Considerations

#### Current Strengths
- Acknowledgment in front matter about Western framework
- Recognition that collectivist cultures differ
- Some international resources in Appendix A

#### Questions for the Author

**Q4.1: "No Contact" as Universal Advice**

The book strongly advocates "no contact" as the optimal healing path. This assumes:
- Individualistic culture where autonomy is valued over family harmony
- Social structures that allow family estrangement
- Economic independence from family

**Questions:**
- How might "no contact" advice land for readers from collectivist cultures (many Asian, Latinx, Middle Eastern, African cultures) where family estrangement means:
  - Loss of entire community?
  - Social death or severe stigma?
  - Economic devastation?
  - Religious consequences?

- Would a section on "Boundaries While Maintaining Contact" serve readers for whom estrangement isn't survivable?

**Q4.2: Communication Norms Across Cultures**

The book identifies certain behaviors as "narcissistic" (indirect communication, emotional guardedness, saving face, etc.).

**Question:** How do you distinguish:
- Manipulation tactics?
- Cultural communication norms that value indirectness, emotional restraint, or collective harmony?

Context: In some cultures, direct confrontation is disrespectful; saving face is protective, not deceptive; emotional restraint is maturity, not withholding. How might readers from these cultures apply this material without pathologizing their cultural norms?

**Q4.3: Family Roles and Cultural Context**

Chapter 7 describes family roles (Scapegoat, Golden Child, etc.) as dysfunction.

**Question:** How do family structures differ in:
- Cultures with extended family households?
- Cultures where eldest child has specific responsibilities?
- Cultures where parental authority is absolute by design?
- Cultures where arranged marriages or family business succession is normal?

How can readers differentiate between cultural structure and narcissistic dysfunction?

### Category 5: Trauma-Informed Approach

#### Current Strengths
- Excellent use of neuroscience to destigmatize
- Emphasis on nervous system states
- Validation of all trauma responses (fight/flight/freeze/fawn)
- Permission to heal at own pace

#### Questions for the Author

**Q5.1: Safety Warnings and Placement**

Rounds 1 & 2 flagged that safety warnings for potentially dangerous content (Exposure Questions in Ch. 13, Exit Phase Escalation in Ch. 11) appear mid-chapter or at the end.

**Question:** What's your thinking on warning placement?

Options to consider:
- Move all safety warnings to line 1 of relevant chapters?
- Add visual markers (borders, icons) to make warnings unmissable?
- Include specific note: "If you're in crisis, skip to Appendix A resources NOW"?

Context: Activated readers in crisis may start reading before encountering warnings. How do you want to balance not alarming readers vs. protecting those in danger?

**Q5.2: Content Warnings and Reader Autonomy**

The book includes some content warnings but not consistently.

**Questions:**
- Which content do you consider "warnable"?
- How specific should warnings be (e.g., "sexual content" vs. "detailed sexual assault discussion")?
- Would a trigger warning index at the front help readers navigate safely?

Content that might warrant consideration:
- Sexual assault/coercion details
- Physical violence descriptions
- Suicide ideation/threats
- Eating disorders (if mentioned)
- Self-harm
- Graphic field notes

**Q5.3: The Testimony Field Note (Ch. 8, lines 117-147)**

This field note describes a child being coached to testify against their father in a custody case, later realizing they were weaponized.

**Context:** "Parental alienation" is a contested concept. While it describes real harm in some cases, it's also weaponized by abusive parents to discredit protective parents.

**Questions:**
- How might this field note be received by:
  - Protective parents (often mothers) fleeing abuse who are accused of "parental alienation"?
  - Survivors who did testify truthfully but are told they were "coached"?

- Would adding context help? E.g., "Custody situations are complex. Real abuse and weaponization both exist. This field note depicts one specific pattern."

**Q5.4: Post-Conflict Sexuality and Consent**

Chapter 4 discusses "makeup sex" as part of trauma bonding. The field note shows a woman engaging sexually after conflict, feeling it's reconciliation, while her partner brags about it as conquest.

**Questions:**
- How do you want to frame consent in trauma-bonded contexts?
- At what point does "makeup sex" become coercion?
- How do you distinguish between:
  - Autonomous choice to reconnect sexually after conflict (healthy)
  - Fawn response masquerading as consent (trauma response)
  - Coerced "reconciliation" (abuse)

Context: This is complex territory. Some survivors struggle to name what happened because there was physical response but not genuine consent. How explicit should the book be about this?

### Category 6: Intersectionality & Inclusive Framing

#### Current Strengths
- Disability resources added (Appendix A)
- Immigrant survivor resources (Appendix A)
- LGBTQ+ section and resources
- Acknowledgment of diverse barriers

#### Questions for the Author

**Q6.1: Economic Privilege in Author Bio**

The author bio mentions three-year global healing journey through Cyprus, Greece, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Mexico, plus various spiritual training certifications.

**Questions:**
- How might this land with readers who:
  - Can't afford therapy?
  - Work multiple jobs to survive?
  - Are trapped economically with abuser?
  - See "healing" requiring resources they don't have?

- Would adding a privilege acknowledgment help? E.g., "I recognize the privilege of accessing these resources. Healing is available to everyone regardless of economic circumstances."

- Should the bio be condensed to focus more on clinical credentials and less on expensive training/travel?

Context: Appendix A now includes "Healing Without Financial Resources" which is excellent. But author bio may still create "healing = expensive" association. Your thoughts?

**Q6.2: Race and Narcissistic Abuse**

Race is never explicitly discussed in the manuscript.

**Questions:**
- How do racism and narcissistic abuse intersect?
  - Racialized gaslighting ("you're being too sensitive about race")
  - Weaponizing stereotypes (angry Black woman, submissive Asian woman, spicy Latina, etc.)
  - Police as unsafe resource for BIPOC survivors
  - Medical racism affecting how abuse symptoms are treated
  - Cultural trauma compounding interpersonal trauma

- Should the book address this, or is it outside the scope?
- Would a note acknowledging what's not covered help?

**Q6.3: Somatic Practices and Accessibility**

The book heavily emphasizes body-based healing: yoga, movement, breathwork, body scans, grounding through physical sensation.

**Questions for readers with:**
- Limited mobility or chronic pain - How do practices adapt?
- Dissociative disorders - How do they approach body practices when body feels unsafe?
- Neurodivergent processing - How do they work with techniques designed for neurotypical processing?
- Deaf/blind readers - How do audio/visual-based instructions translate?

Context: Appendix A mentions some adaptations, but many techniques in Chapters 2, 17, Appendix D assume ability. How might these be written to be universally accessible from the start?

**Q6.4: Language and Translation**

This book is written in English, using English-language metaphors, references, and resources.

**Questions:**
- How do idioms translate? ("Walking on eggshells," "Gray Rock," "Flying Monkeys")
- How do cultural references land? (Wizard of Oz, "decoder ring")
- What resources exist for non-English speakers?

Should the book acknowledge its English-language limitation explicitly?

### Category 7: Potential Unintended Consequences

#### Questions for the Author

**Q7.1: Weaponization Potential**

Any book about manipulation can itself be weaponized.

**Questions:**
- How might an abuser use this material to:
  - Accuse their victim of being the narcissist?
  - Learn new tactics from the playbook chapters?
  - Create more sophisticated manipulation?
  - Use "trauma bond" language to invalidate victim's experience?

- What safeguards exist against this?
- Should there be a note about this possibility?

**Q7.2: Binary Framing Risk**

While the book uses "archetype" language to avoid diagnosing individuals, there's still a binary: narcissist vs. victim, healthy vs. toxic, good vs. bad.

**Questions:**
- How do you address the reality that:
  - People can have narcissistic traits without being "narcissists"?
  - Survivors can use narcissistic defenses as trauma responses?
  - Relationships can have both healthy and unhealthy elements?
  - Recovery involves integrating shadow, not just escaping villains?

- Does the book risk creating a new kind of black-and-white thinking?

**Q7.3: Self-Diagnosis and Confirmation Bias**

Readers seeking answers may read themselves into every pattern.

**Questions:**
- How do you help readers distinguish between:
  - Genuinely abusive patterns?
  - Normal relationship conflict?
  - Their own trauma responses projected onto others?

- What guidance exists for readers who might be hypervigilant from past abuse and seeing narcissists everywhere?

## Final Reflections for the Author

### What Makes This Book Valuable

This book will help survivors. That's clear from every page. The trauma portrayal is careful, the language is respectful, the tools are practical, and the underlying message—you can trust yourself—is vital.

### What This Review Offers

These questions aren't critiques of what you've done wrong. They're invitations to consider:
- How might this land differently than I intend?
- Who might feel excluded or misunderstood?
- Where are my cultural blind spots?
- What unintended messages might I be sending?

You don't need to answer every question or address every gap. But sitting with these questions may help you make conscious choices about:
- What to address in this volume
- What to acknowledge as outside your scope
- What to revisit in future editions
- What additional resources to point readers toward

### Core Questions to Sit With

1. **Who is the implicit "default reader" and who might not see themselves?**
2. **Where does my own privilege (economic, cultural, ability) show up?**
3. **How do I balance accessible language with avoiding stigma?**
4. **What am I not qualified to address, and how do I name that?**
5. **How might my framing be culturally specific rather than universal?**

### Gratitude for What's Already Here

Thank you for:
- Not victim-blaming
- Providing practical tools
- Centering survivor agency
- Including safety resources
- Acknowledging complexity
- Writing with both precision and compassion
- Doing the work to improve through multiple review rounds

### High Priority (Inclusion & Accessibility)

5. Cultural framework acknowledgment (Western individualism limitations)
6. Disability/neurodivergent adaptations (somatic practices accessibility)
7. "Mother/Father Wound" gender binary (consider caregiver role framing)
8. "No contact" cultural limitations (collectivist culture considerations)
9. Race and intersectionality (what's missing/should be acknowledged)

### Medium Priority (Nuance & Clarity)

10. "Narcissist" terminology (stigma vs. pattern recognition)
11. Body wisdom absolutism (trauma responses vs. present danger)
12. "Lack of empathy" language (neurodivergence clarification)
13. Gender diversity in examples (beyond heterosexual default)
14. Weaponization potential (how abusers might use this material)

### Lower Priority (Enhancement Opportunities)
