## Foreword

*By a Fellow Survivor*

---

I wish I had this book ten years ago.

Ten years ago, I was in the thick of it—questioning my own memory, apologizing for things I didn't do, and feeling like I was slowly losing my mind. The person I loved most had convinced me that my perception was broken, that my sensitivity was a flaw, that the problem was always, somehow, me.

I didn't have words for what was happening. I couldn't explain why I felt so exhausted after conversations that looked normal from the outside. I couldn't articulate why "I love you" sometimes felt like a threat. I just knew something was deeply wrong, and I was told—over and over—that the wrongness was me.

When I finally found language for these patterns—gaslighting, love-bombing, trauma bonds—it was like someone had turned on a light in a room I'd been stumbling through in the dark. I wasn't crazy. I wasn't too sensitive. I was responding accurately to something real.

That's what this book offers you: a light.

Jae has done something remarkable here. She's taken the confusing, crazy-making experience of narcissistic abuse and made it *legible*. She's named the patterns so precisely that you'll find yourself saying, "That's exactly what it felt like"—and in that recognition, you'll begin to heal.

This isn't a book that pathologizes or diagnoses. It doesn't tell you to hate anyone. It simply gives you the decoder ring you needed all along—so you can see clearly, protect yourself wisely, and eventually, move forward freely.

If you're holding this book, something in you already knows something is wrong. Trust that knowing. Let these pages validate what your body has been trying to tell you.

And know this: You're not alone. Thousands of us have walked this path. We survived. We healed. We reclaimed ourselves.

You will too.

With love and solidarity,

*A Fellow Survivor*

## Preface

### From Feardom to Freedom: Why I Wrote This Book

---

This book was born from pain—my own, and the pain of hundreds of people I've worked with over the years.

I'm Jennifer Brooke, though most people call me Jae. I hold a Master of Science in Mental Health Counseling and spent years working in traditional talk therapy. I've been a personal trainer, a yoga instructor, an event producer, and a sales professional. But none of those credentials prepared me for what I really needed to learn: how to recognize when love is actually control in disguise.

I didn't set out to become an expert on narcissistic abuse. That expertise found me, the way it finds most of us—through lived experience.

### The Shadow I Had to Face

For years, I allowed myself to shrink in abusive and narcissistic relationships. I was passive-aggressive. I was negative. I blamed others while ignoring my own patterns. I lived with depression and anxiety that I now understand were symptoms of something deeper: I had been conditioned to seek external validation instead of trusting myself. My self-esteem was, in my mentor's words, "mortally wounded."

I had to face all of this through deep Jungian shadow work. Through two transformative experiences called "Transitions," I confronted the parts of myself that had enabled these dynamics to continue. I said goodbye to my need for external approval and love from anyone but myself. I released the toxic patterns I had absorbed—from trauma, from societal conditioning, from fear.

This work was brutally honest. I had to own my part. I had to acknowledge the ways I had been passive in abusive situations. But through this work, I reclaimed my self-worth.

### The Awakening

My spiritual journey truly began with a powerful Kundalini awakening, guided by my coach Peggy Butkus and astrologer Shira Beth Brenner. Two weeks before my father passed away, I received my Reiki I initiation at Maha Rose in New York. That initiation opened my clairvoyance—and on the night my father crossed over, I experienced my first psychic vision.

What followed was a three-year quest across the globe: Cyprus, where I processed my grief through writing and learned to hear beyond the veil. Greece, where I studied astrology with Kaypacha and uncovered my soul's blueprint. Nicaragua, where I broke free from cultural conditioning and learned to think for myself. Costa Rica and Mexico, where I found my spiritual home.

It was in Costa Rica that I met Diego Dosal Stieglitz, who introduced me to Angelina Ataide—the founder of Escola da Aura. In that moment, everything clicked. I had found the modality that would become my life's work: aura therapy, a practice that uses clairvoyant techniques to read the auric field and receive messages directly from Source.

### Why This Book

When I began working with clients, I started seeing the same patterns everywhere. Person after person came carrying the same wounds: the self-doubt, the hypervigilance, the inability to trust their own knowing. They'd been in relationships where love felt like a prison. They'd grown up in families where care came with conditions. They'd lost years to people who used their empathy against them.

And almost universally, they didn't have words for what had happened.

That's why I wrote this book.

Not to create more victims. Not to encourage anyone to diagnose their ex or their mother or their boss. But to provide what I desperately needed and couldn't find: a clear, comprehensive guide to the patterns of control disguised as care.

### What This Book Is and Isn't

**This book is** a pattern recognition guide. It describes behaviors and dynamics, not people. It's designed to help you see clearly, respond effectively, and protect your peace.

**This book is not** a diagnostic manual. It doesn't qualify you to determine whether someone has Narcissistic Personality Disorder. That's a clinical diagnosis requiring professional evaluation. What it does is help you recognize harmful patterns—patterns that cause damage regardless of their clinical origin.

I wrote this book for the person I was years ago: confused, doubting myself, desperately needing someone to validate that what I was experiencing was real. I wrote it for everyone who has been told they were too sensitive when they were actually too perceptive. I wrote it for the empaths, the healers, the people whose capacity for love made them targets.

This is a journey from feardom to freedom. From shadow to light. From separation to unity.

If that's you, I see you. I believe you. And I hope these pages bring you the clarity and freedom you deserve.

With love and fierce protection,

**Jae**

## Acknowledgments

---

This book exists because of the courage of everyone who shared their stories with me—and because of the extraordinary teachers who helped me find my way back to myself.

**To my spiritual mentors:**

To **Angelina Ataide** (Angel), founder of Escola da Aura: You saved my spirit. Through aura therapy, you gave me the tools to see clearly—both into others and into myself. This work would not exist without you.

To **Peggy Butkus**: Your guidance through my Kundalini awakening cracked me open in the most necessary way. You taught me that transformation requires both breaking and rebuilding.

To **Shira Beth Brenner**: Through astrology, you helped me understand my soul's blueprint and showed me that my path, however unconventional, was always written in the stars.

To **Diego Dosal Stieglitz**: You introduced me to my spiritual home and showed me what conscious community looks like. The Transitions experiences you co-created changed my life.

To **Kaypacha**: Your teachings on astrology helped me understand my cosmic purpose.

To **Deborah Rosene, Psy.D.**: Through Qi Gong and Tai Chi, you taught me that healing lives in the body.

**To the teachers whose work shaped my understanding:**

Abraham-Hicks, Dr. Michael Newton, Brian Weiss, and Caroline Myss—your work on the soul's journey gave me context for my experiences and hope for what's possible.

**To my community:**

To Daniel, my partner and our tech wizard. To Diego, Karlita, Dara, and the whole Costa Rica family. To everyone at Amate and the Ekah Collective. Living in conscious community with you is the greatest gift of my healing journey.

**To my clients:**

Thank you for trusting me with your pain, your healing, and your transformation. Every session, every conversation, every "me too" moment taught me something that found its way into these pages. This book is as much yours as it is mine.

**To the survivors who came before:**

The therapists, researchers, writers, and advocates who first named these patterns and created language for the unspeakable—your work made mine possible.

**To my father:**

Who crossed over and, in doing so, opened my clairvoyance. Our conversations beyond the veil taught me that death is not an ending, and that love transcends everything.

**And to you, the reader:**

Thank you for being here. Whatever brought you to these pages—confusion, pain, a desperate need to understand—you're in the right place. The journey ahead won't always be easy, but it will be worth it.

You are not alone.

**Aho.** 🙏

## About This Book

You picked up this book because something felt off.

Maybe it was a relationship that left you questioning your own sanity. Maybe it was a family dynamic that always seemed to drain you, no matter how much you gave. Maybe it was a friendship that felt more like a hostage situation than a connection. Or maybe you're just starting to wake up to patterns you've lived with your entire life—patterns you thought were normal until you realized they weren't.

This book is your decoder ring.

The tactics described in these pages aren't random acts of cruelty. They're a systematic playbook used by people who prioritize control over connection, dominance over intimacy, and their own needs over yours—every single time. Once you can name these patterns, they lose their power over you.

---

## Who This Book Is For

This book is for:

- **The confused** — Anyone who has left an interaction feeling worse about themselves without understanding why
- **The questioning** — Those who wonder if they're "too sensitive" or if something really is wrong
- **The recovering** — People actively healing from narcissistic abuse in any form
- **The awakening** — Those beginning to see family dynamics, friendships, or relationships with new eyes
- **The protecting** — Anyone who wants to recognize these patterns before getting pulled in
- **The helping** — Therapists, coaches, healers, and friends who support survivors

You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis for someone in your life. You don't need to label anyone. You just need to understand the patterns so you can protect your peace.

## A Note on Language

Throughout this book, I use "he/him" pronouns in many examples. This is not because women cannot be narcissists—they absolutely can, and Chapter 6 on Family Systems specifically addresses maternal narcissism. The pronoun choice reflects my personal experience and the examples I had access to while writing.

Please translate any gendered language to fit your situation. The patterns are universal; only the pronouns change.

---

## A Note on Diagnosis

This book does not diagnose anyone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). That's a clinical diagnosis that requires professional evaluation.

What this book *does* do is describe behavioral patterns—patterns that cause real harm regardless of their clinical origin. You don't need a diagnosis to protect yourself from behavior that hurts you. You don't need permission to set boundaries. You don't need a therapist to validate what your body already knows.

If behavior causes harm, you have the right to name it, address it, and remove yourself from it.

---

## The Promise

By the end of this book, you will:

1. **Recognize** the tactics of control disguised as care
2. **Understand** why these patterns hook your nervous system
3. **Decode** manipulation in real-time instead of days later
4. **Respond** from a place of power rather than reaction
5. **Recover** your sense of self and your trust in your own perception
6. **Reclaim** your sovereignty and your right to peace

The confusion ends here.

## Tactical Foundation: The 3-3-3 Rule

Throughout this book, you'll encounter situations where you need to respond in the moment. Before we begin, memorize this framework:

**3 Seconds:** Pause before responding. Count silently. This interrupts the automatic reaction they're counting on.

**3 Breaths:** If activated, take three slow breaths (inhale 4, exhale 6). This engages your parasympathetic nervous system and returns access to your rational brain.

**3 Words (or fewer):** Keep initial responses short. "I'll think about that." "Interesting perspective." "Not for me." The less you say, the less they have to twist.

This book will teach you *what* to say. This rule teaches you *how* to buy time to say it.

---

## Before We Begin

Take a breath.

What you're about to read may activate memories, emotions, and realizations. That's normal. That's part of the process. Your nervous system stored these experiences for a reason—it was trying to protect you.

Now, you're choosing to look directly at what happened. That takes courage.

Go slowly. Put the book down when you need to. Come back when you're ready.

This is not a race. This is a homecoming.
