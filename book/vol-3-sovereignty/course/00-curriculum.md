## Course Modules

### Module 1: The Architecture of Sovereignty
**Lessons:** 5 | **Duration:** ~2 hours

What sovereignty is and isn't. Installing your internal authority.

| Lesson | Title | Duration |
|--------|-------|----------|
| 1.1 | Welcome to Sovereignty | 15 min |
| 1.2 | What Is Sovereignty? | 25 min |
| 1.3 | Installing Internal Authority | 25 min |
| 1.4 | Aura Boundaries: What Is Mine | 25 min |
| 1.5 | Sovereignty Without Force | 20 min |

**Key Scripts:**

**Lesson 1.2: What Is Sovereignty?**
> Sovereignty is the state of being the final authority in your own life. Not domination. Not isolation. Not cold detachment. It's the calm center from which all choice originates. When you're sovereign, you don't need others to validate your decisions. You don't need external permission to feel what you feel. You can be affected without being controlled. You can connect without disappearing.

### Module 2: Holding Your Field
**Lessons:** 5 | **Duration:** ~2 hours

Managing your emotional field. Triggers, desire, and regulation.

| Lesson | Title | Duration |
|--------|-------|----------|
| 2.1 | Holding the Field Without Absorbing It | 25 min |
| 2.2 | When Triggers Return | 25 min |
| 2.3 | Desire Without Urgency | 25 min |
| 2.4 | Soothing and Regulation | 25 min |
| 2.5 | Guilt, Separation, and Emotional Contracts | 20 min |

**Key Scripts:**

**Lesson 2.3: Desire Without Urgency**
> True desire moves at a different speed than craving. Craving says: "I need this now or I will die." Desire says: "I want this, and I can wait for the right timing." The difference is nervous system regulation. When you're dysregulated, everything feels urgent. When you're regulated, you can want something deeply and still be okay if it doesn't happen immediately. Sovereignty gives you access to patient desire.

**Lesson 4.4: Navigating Others' Dysregulation**
> You will encounter people in activated states. Their nervous system will invite yours to join the chaos. Sovereignty means staying grounded when others are not. Not cold—grounded. Not distant—present. You can witness their storm without being swept into it. You can offer calm without abandoning compassion.
