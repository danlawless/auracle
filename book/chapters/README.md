## 🎯 The Core Tools

### The 3-3-3 Rule
Memorize this framework for responding in the moment:

- **3 Seconds:** Pause before responding. Count silently.
- **3 Breaths:** Inhale 4, exhale 6. Engage your parasympathetic nervous system.
- **3 Words (or fewer):** "I'll think about that." "Interesting perspective." "Not for me."

### The 72-Hour Test
Before making any major decision about someone, wait 72 hours:
- Love-bombing neurochemistry needs time to settle
- Patterns invisible in excitement become visible in calm
- Trust the version of yourself that emerges after the intensity fades

## 💬 A Note Before You Begin

> *Take a breath.*
>
> *What you're about to read may activate memories, emotions, and realizations. That's normal. That's part of the process. Your nervous system stored these experiences for a reason—it was trying to protect you.*
>
> *Now, you're choosing to look directly at what happened. That takes courage.*
>
> *Go slowly. Put the book down when you need to. Come back when you're ready.*
>
> *This is not a race. This is a homecoming.*
