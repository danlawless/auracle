## Overview

Hi! I'm Diana, the Developmental Editor. This is Phase 1 of Review Round 4 for Volume 1: The Narcissism Decoder.

**Why Phase 1 matters:** Structural decisions affect everything downstream. Changes to chapter order, content additions/removals, or thematic adjustments must be decided before detailed polish work.
