**Before you begin:** This section covers tactics that often appear during intimate moments, spiritual contexts, and relationship exits. If you're currently in crisis, consider reading Chapter 17 (Energetic Remapping) first for grounding tools.

**Continuing from Part 1:** Tactics 1-19 are covered in [Chapter 3A](./03a-narcissist-playbook-part1.md). This chapter continues with the more advanced and often more dangerous tactics.

---

## Category D: Sexual & Emotional Control

These tactics operate in the realm of intimacy, using closeness as a control mechanism.

---

### Tactic 20: Sexualized Dominance

**What it looks like:** When anger shifts into sexual territory. Commands or demands that feel more about power than desire. Making you feel that obedience equals attraction, that compliance equals intimacy.

**What's really happening:** When someone mixes sex talk with rage, it's not passion. It's control disguised as intimacy. The body's vulnerability during intimacy is being weaponized to re-establish hierarchy.

**How it hooks you:** You conflate intensity with passion. You mistake dominance for desire. You may comply to restore peace or prove your attractiveness.

**Your power move:** Real desire doesn't feel like demand. Real passion doesn't feel like punishment. Trust the difference your body knows.

---

### Tactic 21: Withholding Tenderness

**What it looks like:** Affection disappears when you displease them. Physical warmth is rationed based on your behavior. Touch becomes a reward rather than a given. "I don't feel close to you right now" after you've set a boundary.

**What's really happening:** Basic human needs for warmth and touch are being used as control levers. You're meant to associate boundary-setting with loss of affection, compliance with connection.

**How it hooks you:** You start abandoning your own positions to restore physical closeness. You become hyperaware of what makes them affectionate or distant. Your need for touch overrides your need for self-respect.

**Your power move:** Notice the pattern. Name it to yourself: "Affection is being used as a reward." Real love includes touch that isn't transactional.

---

### Tactic 22: Excessive Flattery Early On (Love-Bombing)

**What it looks like:** Intense attention at the beginning. You're the most amazing person they've ever met. They've never felt this way. Texts all day. Gifts. Grand gestures. Moving fast toward commitment.

**What's really happening:** This isn't love. It's acquisition. The goal is to create a sense of bonded specialness as quickly as possible, before you've seen who they really are. The investment creates a sense of obligation.

**How it hooks you:** It feels incredible. It feels like finally being seen. You compare this intensity to previous relationships and they pale. You invest emotionally before you have enough information.

**Your power move:** Healthy connection builds over time, with consistency. Intensity isn't intimacy. If it feels too good too fast, slow down and observe. Real love can survive taking your time.

---

### Tactic 23: Body Shaming Disguised as Preference

**What it looks like:** "I'm just more attracted to petite women." "I prefer natural beauty." "You'd look better if you..." "I'm not trying to be mean, but have you thought about..."

**What's really happening:** Preferences are being weaponized into criticism. By framing their remarks as personal taste rather than attack, they can wound you while maintaining plausible deniability.

**How it hooks you:** You internalize their "preferences" as your inadequacies. You change your appearance trying to match their stated ideals. You feel less than without them ever saying you are.

**Your power move:** "I'm not here to match your preferences. I'm here to live in my body." Your body is your home; their opinions are just weather.

---

## ⏸️ Pause Point: Body Check

Tactics involving sexuality and the body can activate deep responses. Before continuing:

**Physical grounding:**
- Squeeze your hands together, then release
- Roll your shoulders back three times
- Place your hand on your heart and take three breaths

**Affirmation:** Your body belongs to you. Your boundaries are valid. Your comfort matters.

When you're ready, continue.

---

## Category E: Energetic & Spiritual Distortion

These tactics target your perception, intuition, and sense of meaning.

---

### Tactic 24: Energy Invalidation

**What it looks like:** "I don't believe in that stuff." "You're imagining things." "That's all in your head." "There's no such thing as 'energy.'" "You're being paranoid."

**What's really happening:** Your intuition has detected something they don't want seen. By dismissing your perception as nonsensical, they protect themselves from accountability. If your feelings aren't real, they don't have to address the cause.

**Why naming energy threatens them:** When you say "your energy feels bad" or "something feels off," you're naming what they're actively trying to hide. Their entire strategy depends on the surface appearing fine while manipulation operates underneath. Your intuition cuts through the performance and sees the real dynamic, and that threatens their control. They can't manipulate what you've already identified. This is why the dismissal is often so intense. You've exposed the mechanism.

**How it hooks you:** You doubt your intuition. You stop trusting the subtle signals that tell you something is wrong. You defer to their "logical" framework even when your body is screaming.

**Your power move:** "My perception is valid whether or not you share it." You don't need their agreement to trust what you feel.

> *"When you said 'your energy feels bad,' you named what they were trying to hide—and that threatened them."*

---

### Tactic 25: Moral Camouflage

**What it looks like:** Vices reframed as "medicine" or "coping." Destructive behavior explained with spiritual language. "I'm just being authentic." "The universe told me to." "It's my journey." "I'm healing my shadow."

**What's really happening:** Spirituality is being used as a shield against accountability. By wrapping harmful behavior in evolved-sounding language, they make criticism seem unspiritual, judgmental, or unenlightened.

**How it hooks you:** You feel like you can't challenge behavior that's dressed up as growth. You doubt your own "level of consciousness" for seeing harm. You enable in the name of supporting their journey.

**Your power move:** Real spirituality increases accountability, not decreases it. Watch for the gap between their words and their impact.

---

### Tactic 26: Authority Hijack

**What it looks like:** They tell you what your intuition means. They interpret your dreams, your feelings, your experiences. They position themselves as having greater spiritual insight than you. "What you're really feeling is..."

**What's really happening:** Your inner authority is being colonized. By becoming the interpreter of your inner world, they insert themselves between you and your own truth.

**How it hooks you:** You start deferring to their interpretation of your experience. You trust their reading of you more than your reading of you. Your spiritual life passes through them.

**Your power move:** "I appreciate your perspective, but I'm the authority on my own experience." No one gets to tell you what you feel.

---

### Tactic 27: Control Through Fatigue

**What it looks like:** Late-night arguments that go for hours. Constant contact that leaves no room for rest. Emotional intensity that depletes your reserves. Always something requiring your attention.

**What's really happening:** Exhaustion is a control tool. When you're depleted, you're more compliant. You don't have energy to fight, to think critically, or to leave. They may not consciously plan this, but they benefit from it.

**How it hooks you:** You're too tired to trust your own judgment. You agree to things you wouldn't normally accept. You can't imagine having the energy to leave.

**Your power move:** Protect your rest fiercely. Arguments that "have to happen tonight" almost never do. "I'm not discussing this when I'm exhausted. We'll talk tomorrow."

---

### Tactic 28: Pity Play (The Pity Control Cycle)

**What it looks like:** When confronted about lying, cheating, or crossing a clear boundary, they don't apologize or take responsibility. Instead, they pivot to self-pity: "I always ruin the good things," "I don't know why I'm like this," "I'm broken," "I sabotage myself." Or they invoke their wounded past: "You don't understand what I've been through," "My parents were terrible, that's why I'm this way," "I've been abandoned by everyone."

**What's really happening:** This isn't a confession. It's a deflection. The emotional burden shifts from them being harmful to them being hurt. They'd rather be the victim, the tragic antihero, the "broken person" than the one who caused harm. Narcissistic patterns can't tolerate being seen as "the bad guy."

**The structure is always the same:**

1. **Gets caught / exposed** — Behavior is confronted
2. **Plays helpless victim** — "I ruin everything"
3. **Emotional disarmament** — You shift from anger → compassion
4. **Invites emotional labor** — You begin comforting them
5. **Regains control** — They're no longer the one in the wrong

**How it hooks you:** You feel sympathy instead of anger. Your guard lowers. You feel guilty for being upset. You shift from confronting to caretaking, comforting the person who hurt you. This reversal is the goal. The pity play accomplishes three things instantly:

1. **Stops accountability.** You can't stay angry at a "wounded soul"
2. **Reverses roles.** Suddenly you feel bad for them
3. **Re-opens emotional access.** Now you're managing their feelings instead of addressing their behavior

This is trauma-bond gold. Your empathy activates. You make allowances. You excuse behavior because you understand its origins. You become their therapist, not their equal.

**Why this works on compassionate people:** Someone empathetic sees their "pain" and thinks, "They're hurting. This isn't about me." This reinforces the trauma bond through intensity, caretaking, pity-as-connection, and guilt-as-love. You justify the original betrayal because you're now emotionally managing their feelings.

**What they NEVER do:** With real guilt, someone says:
- "I hurt you. That was wrong."
- "I crossed a boundary."
- "I apologize."
- "How do I repair this?"

Someone using pity control never does this. Real accountability threatens the ego.

**Your power move:** Do NOT comfort them. Their "pain" is a shield, not a wound.

If they say "I sabotage myself," respond: "That's something you'll need to work on, but it doesn't excuse what happened."

Do NOT redirect to their emotions. Stay on behavior, not their inner world.

Hold accountability steady: "Regardless of why, the action was wrong."

Withdraw emotional labor. That is the real boundary.

> *"Their 'I'm broken' isn't vulnerability—it's a strategy to make you the caretaker of the person who hurt you."*

---

### Tactic 29: Suicide Threats

**What it looks like:** "If you leave, I'll kill myself." "I can't live without you." "I'll jump off this balcony right now." They threaten self-harm when you try to set boundaries or end the relationship. The threat may be explicit or implied through concerning statements about not wanting to live, references to methods, or dramatic gestures.

**What's really happening:** They're taking you emotionally hostage. By making you responsible for their life, they trap you in the relationship through fear and guilt. The threat weaponizes your empathy and sense of responsibility. Whether or not they mean it, the effect is the same. You're paralyzed by the possibility.

**How it hooks you:** You're terrified something will happen and it will be your fault. You stay to keep them alive. You abandon your own needs and boundaries because "at least they'll be safe." You become their suicide prevention plan, not their partner. The weight is unbearable, but leaving feels impossible.

**Your power move:** You are not responsible for another adult's choice to live or die. This is emotional hostage-taking, and it's a form of abuse. If they threaten suicide: call 911 or a crisis line immediately. Do not try to manage this yourself. Contact their family or friends. Then still leave if you need to leave. Their life is their responsibility, not yours. If they were genuinely suicidal, they need professional help you cannot provide. If they're using the threat to control you, they need you to stop rewarding the manipulation.

> *"Making you responsible for their life is the ultimate control. You cannot save someone by sacrificing yourself."*

## ⏸️ Pause Point: Grounding After Heavy Content

Tactics 28 and 29 can be particularly triggering. Please pause here if needed.

**Grounding exercise:**

1. **Stand up and shake your body** for 30 seconds—arms, legs, shoulders. Let the tension move.
2. **Splash cold water on your face** or hold ice cubes. Physical sensation anchors you.
3. **Name where you are:** "I am in [location]. It is [time]. I am safe right now."

**Reminder:** You are reading about these patterns so you can recognize them. Recognition is protection. You're doing important work.

When you feel steady, continue.

---

## Category F: Post-Encounter Manipulation

These tactics occur after conflict, after separation, or during "reconciliation."

---

### Tactic 30: Guilt Hook

**What it looks like:** "After everything I've done for you." "Remember when I helped you with...?" "I've given so much and this is how you treat me?"

**What's really happening:** Previous kindnesses are being converted into debt. Every nice thing they've ever done becomes leverage. You're meant to feel that you owe them compliance forever.

**How it hooks you:** You feel indebted. You minimize current harm because of past help. You stay because leaving seems ungrateful.

**Your power move:** Kindness given freely isn't a loan. Real generosity doesn't come with a ledger. "I'm grateful for what you've done. That doesn't mean I accept how you're treating me now."

---

### Tactic 31: Smear Pre-emptive

**What it looks like:** They criticize your friends before you've confided in them. They question your therapist's qualifications. They suggest your family doesn't really understand you. "Are you sure you can trust them?"

**What's really happening:** They're isolating you from potential sources of reality-checking. If they can undermine your confidence in outside perspectives, you'll have only their voice to trust.

**How it hooks you:** You start doubting people who haven't done anything wrong. You pull back from relationships that might support you. You become more dependent on their version of reality.

**Your power move:** Notice when someone consistently diminishes others in your life. Maintain connections with people who know you. A partner who wants you isolated isn't protecting you. They're controlling you.

---

### Tactic 32: "You'd Be Lucky to Be With Me"

**What it looks like:** After conflict: "Any other woman would be grateful." "You don't know how good you have it." "Good luck finding someone who puts up with you." "You'll never find anyone like me."

**What's really happening:** This is ego reassertion after their control has been threatened. By reminding you of your supposed luck, they re-establish the hierarchy. They're the prize, you're the lucky recipient.

**How it hooks you:** You feel lucky to be tolerated rather than valued for who you are. You lower your expectations. You accept treatment you wouldn't accept from anyone else.

**Your power move:** "I'm not in this relationship because I'm lucky. I'm in it because I choose to be—and I can choose differently."

---

### Tactic 33: Withholding as Punishment

**What it looks like:** Silence. One-word answers. Cold acknowledgment. Physically present but emotionally gone. They're there, but it's clear you're being punished. After you reach out sincerely or apologize, they respond with silence or minimal, symbolic messages: "Happy birthday." (period, no warmth, no follow-up). They don't engage with your apology or repair attempt. Contact becomes flat, emotionally void.

**What's really happening:** Withdrawal of normal warmth is being used as a control mechanism. You're meant to feel the cold and work to restore warmth, usually by capitulating to whatever triggered the withdrawal.

When this happens after you apologize, withholding becomes a way to retain power after you've taken responsibility. When you apologize or soften, they lose their leverage, moral high ground, and the grievance that justified distance. Withholding restores that imbalance without confrontation. It's control through absence.

**The psychological move:** Instead of mutual repair, they avoid vulnerability, avoid their own accountability, preserve distance as safety, and maintain superiority by not engaging.

Distance becomes the message.

**Why it hurts more than silence:** Because it says, "I'll acknowledge you just enough to stay relevant, but not enough to be relational." It keeps you emotionally activated without offering connection. It's presence without presence.

**How it hooks you:** You feel desperate to restore connection. You chase. You apologize for things you didn't do wrong. You abandon your positions just to end the silence.

After an apology, you think, "I should explain better," "I should try again," "Time will fix this if I'm patient." No. This response is not feedback. It's a boundary they are enforcing without stating it.

**What this behavior protects in them:**
- Avoidance of closeness
- Avoidance of shared responsibility
- Avoidance of emotional risk
- Preservation of control without dialogue

Repair would require reciprocity. Withholding avoids it.

**The correct internal reframe:** "Repair is mutual or it's not repair. I completed my part. The relationship's capacity is now visible."

**Your power move:** Don't chase. Name it: "I notice you're withdrawn. I'm here when you're ready to talk directly about what's going on." Then return to your own life. Fill the space they've vacated with people who show up fully.

After an apology that's met with withholding: Do nothing. No follow-up. No clarification. No second letter. No emotional inquiry. You let the minimal contact be what it is.

**Key truth:** An apology is not a down payment that entitles someone to keep you waiting. If repair is not met with engagement, the relationship has reached its functional limit.

> *"When I owned my part and silence followed, I realized the apology wasn't the bridge—it was the boundary."*

---

### Tactic 34: Withholding Belongings as Control

**What it looks like:** After separation, they won't return your things. They make excuses, delay, create complications. Getting your belongings back becomes an ongoing negotiation.

**What's really happening:** Your possessions have become leverage. As long as they have something of yours, they have a reason to stay in contact, a way to keep you engaged, a power play that extends the relationship beyond its end.

**How it hooks you:** You need your things. You keep reaching out. Each interaction gives them another opportunity to manipulate, test, or re-engage you. The "stuff" becomes an excuse for continued connection.

**Your power move:** Decide what's worth the engagement. For truly valuable items, use a third party (friend, courier, mediator) to retrieve them. For items of lower value, consider whether the peace of letting go outweighs the object's worth. Don't let possessions become chains.

---

### Tactic 35: Concern as Control

**What it looks like:** "Just checking on you," "I was worried about you," "I noticed you haven't texted," "Where are you? Who are you with?" It sounds caring on the surface.

**What's really happening:** Surveillance disguised as concern. This implies you might not be okay without their monitoring. It positions them as the "protector" and you as the one needing checking on. The intrusion comes wrapped in care.

**How it hooks you:** You feel touched that someone cares. Questioning their concern feels ungrateful. You start reporting your whereabouts to avoid their "worry." Your independence becomes negotiable. Your autonomy shrinks incrementally.

**Your power move:** "I'm fine—I'll reach out if I need anything." Don't explain, justify, or provide details. Caring people trust your ability to manage yourself. If they push: "I appreciate the thought, but I'm good." Then hold that boundary.

*Note: See also Decoder Card 1 (Chapter 14) for quick reference on this pattern.*

> *"Control rarely storms the gate; it flatters its way inside."*

---

### Tactic 36: The "Huh?" Gaslight Loop

**What it looks like:** Repeated confusion responses when you express yourself clearly: "Huh? What do you mean?" "That doesn't make sense," "I don't understand what you're saying," "You're not being clear." Blank stares or dismissive sighs.

**What's really happening:** Your way of expressing yourself is being framed as nonsensical. This puts you in the position of explaining, re-explaining, and doubting whether you're communicating clearly. The confusion is manufactured. It's not that they don't understand. It's that they don't want to engage with what you actually said.

**How it hooks you:** You try harder to be understood. You question your communication skills. You feel stupid or crazy. You over-explain to be "clear," which gives them more material to twist or dismiss. You become responsible for their comprehension.

**Your power move:** Don't elaborate or re-explain. "I was clear. Let me know when you're ready to engage with what I said." Their confusion is their problem, not yours to solve. You can also simply repeat what you said once, verbatim, and then go silent.

> *"When someone pretends not to understand you, they're refusing to meet you—not failing to grasp you."*

---

### Tactic 37: Post-Apology Minimal Contact

**What it looks like:** After you send a sincere apology or letter owning your part, they do not engage with the content. Contact becomes minimal, flat, or symbolic only. Example: "Happy birthday." (period, no warmth, no follow-up). They acknowledge you just enough to stay present but not enough to actually connect.

**What's really happening:** Your apology removed their leverage. They can no longer hold moral superiority, keep the conflict alive, or maintain a grievance-based identity. So they withdraw instead of reconnect. This is not reconciliation avoidance. It's control through absence. Symbolic contact without warmth reopens emotional doors without offering safety, keeps you in limbo, maintains hierarchy, and prevents closure.

**How it hooks you:** Because it's not complete silence, you hold out hope. You think, "Maybe I didn't apologize well enough," "Maybe I should try again," "Maybe time will soften this." You stay emotionally activated waiting for connection that never comes.

**Your power move:** Recognize that minimal contact after genuine repair is a statement about their capacity, not your worthiness. Do nothing. No follow-up. No clarification. No second letter. An apology is not a down payment that entitles someone to keep you waiting. If repair is not met with engagement, the relationship has reached its functional limit.

*Note: See also Decoder Card 23 (Chapter 15) for quick reference on this pattern.*

---

### Tactic 38: Trivial Demand Tests

**What it looks like:** Small, seemingly unreasonable requests that serve as compliance tests. "Get me another popsicle." "Pick that up for me." "Come here right now." When you don't immediately comply, they escalate dramatically: yelling, making a scene, perhaps in front of others. Afterward: "If you had just done what I wanted in the first place, none of this would have happened."

**What's really happening:** The request was never about the object. It was about testing dominance. Your non-compliance threatened their control, and the explosion was punishment designed to ensure future compliance. They're training you to obey immediately, even for unreasonable demands.

**How it hooks you:** You start complying with small requests immediately because you've learned that resistance, even to trivial demands, results in disproportionate consequences that will somehow be your fault. You walk on eggshells, managing your responses to avoid their explosions.

**Your power move:** Recognize trivial demands for what they are: power plays. Your refusal to fetch something on command isn't what caused their explosion. Their need for control caused it. "I'm not responsible for your reaction to my boundaries."

---

### Tactic 39: The Inversion + Entitlement Pattern (DARVO Sequence)

**What it looks like:** After extracting significant value—financial, emotional, or otherwise—from you or the relationship, they reframe the story when outcomes don't match their internal fantasy. Someone who took more than they gave suddenly positions themselves as the one who was "betrayed" or "abandoned." They may have benefited financially while you contributed labor, thinking, and time. When results disappoint them, the narrative flips: "You failed me." "You abandoned me." "I was betrayed."

This often appears in:
- Business partnerships where one party extracted financial benefit while the other contributed work
- Relationships where one person's expectations were never actually agreed upon
- Situations where they want "image management" over accountability—hiding the breakup, controlling optics, keeping you quiet—while simultaneously devaluing you

**What's really happening:** This is a classic **DARVO sequence**—Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender:

1. **Deny responsibility:** "I thought it would be done sooner" (denying that uncertainty was inherent, that timelines weren't guaranteed)
2. **Attack:** "You failed me" (attacking your competence, effort, or character)
3. **Reverse Victim and Offender:** "You abandoned me" (positioning themselves as the victim when they were actually the one who extracted value)

The inversion serves a psychological function: **externalizing disappointment**. When reality doesn't match their internal fantasy timeline or expectation, shame is intolerable. So they deposit it in you. Your "failure" becomes the explanation for their unmet expectations—rather than their unrealistic assumptions or the inherent uncertainty of any endeavor.

**The financial asymmetry tells the truth:** Look at who benefited materially. Who took more out than they put in? Who bore the risk while the other collected reward? When someone takes disproportionate financial benefit, holds unrealistic expectations, and then reframes unmet outcomes as personal betrayal—they're avoiding accountability, not naming reality.

**How it hooks you:** You feel compelled to defend your effort, relitigate timelines, re-explain intentions. You may even start doubting yourself—*Did* I fail them? *Was* I wrong? The guilt appears. The urge to explain rises.

But nothing you say will land. The story was already written before the conversation started. They need you to be the problem so they don't have to face their own role.

**What NOT to do:**
- Do not argue timelines
- Do not defend effort
- Do not re-litigate intentions
- Do not agree just to keep peace (agreement in this context = self-erasure)

**Your power move:** Recognize what's actually happening:

> *"They took disproportionate benefit, held unrealistic expectations, and are now reframing unmet outcomes as personal betrayal to avoid accountability."*

That's the truth, distilled. No drama required.

If closure language is needed:

> *"We're not aligned on scope, expectations, or responsibility. I'm complete with this and won't be continuing further discussion."*

This does not accuse. Does not explain. Does not invite debate. It ends the frame.

If they push for image control ("Let's keep this quiet," "Don't tell anyone what happened"):

> *"I'm not available for managing narratives. I'll be truthful if asked."*

That's a boundary, not a threat.

**The key reframe:** When someone says "You betrayed me" but the facts show they extracted value and avoided shared risk, what they're really saying is:

> *"You stopped carrying my disappointment for me."*

That's not betrayal. That's separation.

*See also: Tactic 6 (Shame Inversion), Tactic 18 (Reversal of Blame), Tactic 28 (Pity Play). Chapter 18 has full closure scripts for this pattern.*

## How to Use This Chapter

This playbook isn't meant to be memorized. It's meant to be referenced.

When something happens and you feel confused, return here. Ask: "Which tactic is this?" The moment you can name it, you've already started to step outside its power.

Keep in mind:
- Not every instance of these behaviors indicates a narcissist. Context matters. Patterns matter. The consistent use of multiple tactics over time is what reveals the larger picture.
- People can do these things unconsciously. That doesn't mean you have to accept them.
- Your job isn't to diagnose anyone. Your job is to recognize what's happening and respond in ways that protect your peace.

The playbook exists. Now you can read it.

- Your intuition doesn't require their validation
- Pain explains behavior; it doesn't excuse it
- Protect your rest—exhaustion is a control tool

**For all post-encounter tactics (30-38):**
- Past kindness isn't a loan requiring repayment
- Your belongings aren't worth ongoing engagement
- Silence is a complete sentence
- Concern can be control. Trust your discomfort
- Confusion as a tactic deserves no explanation
- Minimal contact after repair reveals capacity, not worth
- Trivial demands are tests of dominance, not requests

**For inversion + entitlement patterns (39):**
- Look at who actually benefited—financial asymmetry tells the truth
- Expectation without agreement isn't your failure
- You can't correct someone invested in misunderstanding
- Separation isn't betrayal—it's autonomy
- Don't manage their narrative. Be truthful if asked

*"When you can name what's happening, it stops happening to you and starts happening in front of you."*
