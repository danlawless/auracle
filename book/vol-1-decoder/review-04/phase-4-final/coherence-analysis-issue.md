## Section A: Internal Consistency (Q1-Q3)

### Q1: Terminology Consistency

**The Question:** Is terminology used consistently throughout the manuscript?

**Options:**
- [x] A) Terminology is consistent throughout

**Editor Comments:**

Comprehensive scan confirms consistent terminology usage:

| Term | Consistency | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| "Control disguised as care" | ✅ Consistent | Established Ch. 1, echoed throughout |
| "Gradual dimming" | ✅ Consistent | Metaphor introduced Ch. 1, callbacks added in Ch. 17, Ch. 19 |
| "Wolf in sheep's clothing" | ✅ Consistent | Master metaphor from Ch. 1, referenced in decoder cards |
| "Gray Rock" | ✅ Consistent | Capitalized consistently as proper noun |
| "Power Move" | ✅ Consistent | Fixed in Phase 3 (was lowercase in one instance) |
| "Supply" / "narcissistic supply" | ✅ Consistent | Clinical term used consistently |
| "Energetic signature" | ✅ Consistent | Ch. 2 concept, referenced appropriately later |
| "Neuroception" | ✅ Consistent | Defined in Ch. 2, used correctly thereafter |

The manuscript uses "survivor" rather than "victim" in recovery chapters, which is intentional and appropriate for the empowerment arc.

**Recommendation:** Option A - Terminology is consistent throughout ✅

---

### Q2: Concept Introduction Sequencing

**The Question:** Are concepts introduced before being referenced?

**Options:**
- [x] A) All concepts introduced before use

**Editor Comments:**

Concept sequencing is well-ordered:

| Concept | Introduced | First Referenced Later |
|---------|------------|----------------------|
| "72-Hour Test" | Ch. 1:98-133 | Later chapters reference appropriately |
| "Gradual Dimming" | Ch. 1:137-171 | Ch. 17, Ch. 19 callbacks |
| Body signals / neuroception | Ch. 2 | Body checks throughout |
| 38 Tactics | Ch. 3A/3B | Decoder cards (Ch. 14) reference these |
| Narcissist Types | Ch. 5 | Type-specific strategies follow |
| "False Ideal" | Ch. 5:44-125 | Referenced in context of rage/injury |
| Trauma bonding | Ch. 4 | Recovery chapters build on this |

The manuscript establishes foundational concepts in Part I before building complexity in Parts II-V. Forward references (e.g., "Chapter 14 will provide...") are appropriately signposted.

**Recommendation:** Option A - All concepts introduced before use ✅

---

### Q3: Cross-Reference Accuracy

**The Question:** Are all cross-references accurate after Round 3 restructuring?

**Options:**
- [x] A) All cross-references accurate

**Editor Comments:**

Spot-checked cross-references across key chapters:

| Reference | Location | Target | Accurate? |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| "Chapter 14" (decoder cards) | Ch. 1:77 | Ch. 14 | ✅ |
| "Part II" transition | Ch. 5:631-644 | Part II begins Ch. 4 | ✅ |
| "Chapter 18's exit planning" | Ch. 13:16 | Ch. 18 | ✅ |
| "Appendix A" resources | Ch. 13:17, Ch. 19:219 | Appendix A | ✅ |
| "Chapter 17" practices | Ch. 19:284 | Ch. 17 | ✅ |
| "Chapter 1" gradual dimming | Ch. 17:51 | Ch. 1:137-171 | ✅ |

The Chapter 3A/3B split (38 tactics) maintains consistent internal references. No orphaned or broken references detected.

**Recommendation:** Option A - All cross-references accurate ✅

---

## Section B: Logical Structure (Q4-Q6)

### Q4: Chapter Order Logic

**The Question:** Does the chapter order support reader understanding?

**Options:**
- [x] A) Chapter order is logical and effective

**Editor Comments:**

The 5-part structure follows a clear pedagogical arc:

```
Part I: Recognition (What is happening?)
  └── Ch. 1: Opening Manifesto - Orientation
  └── Ch. 2: Energetic Signature - Body awareness
  └── Ch. 3A/3B: Tactics (38 patterns)

Part II: Understanding Origins (Why does this happen?)
  └── Ch. 4: Trauma Bonds - Neuroscience
  └── Ch. 5: Types - Classification
  └── Ch. 6-10: Family systems, childhood patterns

Part III: Context (Where does this appear?)
  └── Ch. 11-12: Romantic, workplace, other contexts
  └── Ch. 13: Exposure Questions - Testing

Part IV: Tools (What can I use?)
  └── Ch. 14-16: Decoder Cards (52 cards)

Part V: Recovery (How do I heal?)
  └── Ch. 17: Energetic Remapping
  └── Ch. 18: Practical Responses
  └── Ch. 19: Moving Forward
```

This progression from awareness → understanding → context → tools → healing supports readers at any entry point while rewarding linear reading.

**Recommendation:** Option A - Chapter order is logical and effective ✅

---

### Q5: Part Groupings Coherence

**The Question:** Do the 5 parts create logical groupings?

| Part | Purpose | Coherent? |
|------|---------|-----------|
| I: Recognition | Identify behaviors | 5/5 |
| II: Understanding | Explore origins | 5/5 |
| III: Context | Apply to relationships | 5/5 |
| IV: Tools | Provide references | 5/5 |
| V: Recovery | Guide healing | 5/5 |

**Options:**
- [x] A) Part groupings are coherent

**Editor Comments:**

Part boundaries are clear and logical:

- **Part I → Part II transition** (after Ch. 3B): Reader moves from "what" to "why"
- **Part II → Part III transition** (after Ch. 10): From origins to present contexts
- **Part III → Part IV transition** (after Ch. 13): From recognition to practical tools
- **Part IV → Part V transition** (after Ch. 16): From reference to healing

Each part builds on the previous while serving readers who may enter at different points. The "Pause After" interstitial chapters provide appropriate rest between dense sections.

**Recommendation:** Option A - Part groupings are coherent ✅

---

### Q6: Appendix Integration

**The Question:** Are appendices properly integrated and referenced?

**Options:**
- [x] D) Current integration is appropriate

**Editor Comments:**

Appendix references appear at appropriate moments:

- Ch. 13 (Safety Warning): References Appendix A for crisis resources
- Ch. 19 (Recovery): References Appendix A for 90-Day Stabilization Plan
- Decoder Cards: Reference appendix for additional resources

Appendix integration is functional without being intrusive. Readers who need resources are directed; those who don't aren't disrupted.

**Recommendation:** Option D - Current integration is appropriate ✅

---

## Section C: Throughlines (Q7-Q10)

### Q7: Core Theme Maintenance

**The Question:** Are core themes maintained consistently?

Core themes verified:
- ✅ "Your body knows first" - Established Ch. 2, Body Checks throughout
- ✅ "Control disguised as care" - Ch. 1 foundational concept, referenced consistently
- ✅ "Recognition → Understanding → Sovereignty" - Arc visible across all 5 parts
- ✅ "You are not alone" - Field Notes demonstrate shared experience throughout

**Options:**
- [x] A) Core themes consistently maintained

**Editor Comments:**

The manuscript maintains remarkable thematic consistency:

**"Gradual Dimming" metaphor arc:**
- Ch. 1:137-171: Introduced as master metaphor for control
- Ch. 17:49-52: Callback - "Remember the gradual dimming... This is how we bring them back up"
- Ch. 19:335: Closure - "The gradual dimming has reversed. You remember what brightness feels like"

**Body-first awareness:**
- Every chapter includes body-awareness touchpoints
- "Body Check" boxes throughout reinforce somatic attention
- Recovery chapters (17-19) bring body awareness full circle

**Sovereignty arc:**
- Ch. 1: Introduces concept
- Throughout: Builds reader capacity
- Ch. 19: "Sovereignty Statement" provides climactic declaration

**Recommendation:** Option A - Core themes consistently maintained ✅

---

### Q8: Narrative Arc Clarity

**The Question:** Is the reader's journey arc clear?

Arc: Recognition → Understanding → Naming → Tools → Boundaries → Sovereignty

**Options:**
- [x] A) Arc is clear and compelling

**Editor Comments:**

The reader journey follows a clear therapeutic arc:

```
Ch. 1-3: RECOGNITION
"Something is wrong, and now I can name it"

Ch. 4-10: UNDERSTANDING
"Now I understand why and how this happened"

Ch. 11-13: CONTEXT
"I see this pattern in multiple areas of my life"

Ch. 14-16: TOOLS
"I have resources to recognize and respond"

Ch. 17-19: SOVEREIGNTY
"I am reclaiming my life"
```

The arc is explicit in Ch. 1's "Road Ahead" section, which maps the journey for readers upfront. Ch. 19's closing brings full circle with "Welcome home."

**Recommendation:** Option A - Arc is clear and compelling ✅

---

### Q9: Emotional Arc Coherence

**The Question:** Does the emotional journey make sense?

Expected arc: Confusion → Validation → Grief → Anger → Acceptance → Empowerment

**Options:**
- [x] A) Emotional arc is coherent

**Editor Comments:**

The emotional journey is carefully calibrated:

| Stage | Chapters | Emotional Work |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Confusion → Validation | Ch. 1-2 | "You're not crazy" |
| Recognition → Naming | Ch. 3 | Power of language |
| Understanding → Grief | Ch. 4-10 | Processing origins |
| Awareness → Anger | Ch. 11-13 | Seeing clearly |
| Tools → Confidence | Ch. 14-16 | Building capacity |
| Integration → Sovereignty | Ch. 17-19 | Reclaiming self |

The manuscript acknowledges that emotions don't follow linear paths (Ch. 19:79-82: "These feelings can coexist"). Pause chapters provide emotional rest between intense sections.

**Recommendation:** Option A - Emotional arc is coherent ✅
