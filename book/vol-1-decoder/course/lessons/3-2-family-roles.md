### Script

For many of us, the patterns we've been studying didn't begin with a romantic partner or a difficult friend.

They began at home.

The family system is often where we first learned to recognize—or not recognize—manipulation. It's where we learned our role. It's where the template for all future relationships was written.

In this lesson, we'll decode how narcissistic dynamics operate in families.

**The narcissistic family structure**

In a healthy family, each member is seen as an individual with their own needs, feelings, and path.

In a narcissistic family, members exist to serve the needs of the narcissistic parent. Children aren't raised—they're assigned roles that manage the parent's emotional state.

These roles aren't chosen. They're imposed. And they often persist long into adulthood.

**The core roles**

**The Golden Child**

This child can do no wrong. They're held up as evidence of the parent's excellence. They receive attention, praise, and resources.

But there's a cost.

The Golden Child must reflect the parent's glory. They can't have needs that interfere. They can't fail. They can't be an individual separate from the parent's vision.

Golden Children often struggle with:
- Perfectionism and fear of failure
- Difficulty with authentic identity
- Entitled expectations from others
- Guilt about siblings who weren't chosen

**The Scapegoat**

This child can do no right. They're blamed for family problems. They receive criticism, punishment, and sometimes abuse.

The Scapegoat serves a crucial function: they carry the badness so everyone else doesn't have to. The family's dysfunction has a target, and that target is one child.

Scapegoats often struggle with:
- Chronic shame and self-blame
- Difficulty accepting good treatment
- Hypervigilance and anxiety
- Either overachievement (proving worth) or underachievement (fulfilling prophecy)

**The Invisible Child**

This child isn't seen at all. They fly under the radar—neither praised nor blamed, just overlooked.

Invisibility is a survival strategy. If you're not noticed, you're not targeted. But the cost is developing without being witnessed.

Invisible Children often struggle with:
- Difficulty knowing who they are
- Feeling like they don't matter
- Either extreme people-pleasing or extreme withdrawal
- Difficulty believing they deserve attention

**The Caretaker (or Fixer)**

This child manages the family's emotional needs. They mediate conflicts. They comfort others. They carry responsibilities inappropriate for their age.

The Caretaker exists to stabilize the unstable system. They sacrifice their own needs to keep the peace.

Caretakers often struggle with:
- Difficulty knowing their own needs
- Resentment under a pleasant surface
- Attracting partners who need caretaking
- Inability to receive care

**Role fluidity**

It's important to understand that these roles aren't always fixed.

Sometimes roles shift depending on which child is present. Sometimes they shift when the narcissist needs something different.

A Golden Child might become a Scapegoat the moment they assert independence. A Scapegoat might be temporarily elevated when the narcissist needs an ally.

This unpredictability is itself a control mechanism. You never know which version of yourself they need you to be.

**Triangulation**

Triangulation is one of the most common manipulation tactics in family systems.

Instead of direct communication, the narcissistic parent communicates through third parties. They tell one child about another. They create alliances and conflicts. They keep everyone off-balance by controlling information flow.

Common triangulation patterns:

**Playing children against each other.** "Your sister would never talk to me that way." This creates competition and prevents siblings from uniting against the dysfunction.

**Using children as messengers.** "Tell your father that..." The child becomes a pawn in adult conflict, exposed to information they shouldn't carry.

**Creating loyalty tests.** "If you really loved me, you'd take my side." Children are forced to choose between parents or between family members.

**Sharing inappropriate information.** The narcissist confides adult problems in children, making them emotional caretakers and creating unhealthy alliance.

**The function of triangulation**

Why do narcissistic parents triangulate?

**Control.** When they're at the center of all communication, they control what everyone knows. They can present different stories to different people. They can't be challenged because no one has the full picture.

**Narcissistic supply.** Triangulation creates drama. It positions them as the central figure everyone is revolving around.

**Prevention of alliance.** If the children united, they might see the truth. Triangulation keeps them competing, distrustful of each other, and focused on the parent.

**Escape from accountability.** When there's always a third party to blame or involve, the narcissist never has to be accountable for their direct impact.

**The lasting impact**

If you grew up in a narcissistic family system, these patterns are in your wiring.

You may automatically take roles in new relationships—becoming the caretaker in your marriage, the scapegoat at work, the invisible one among friends.

You may reflexively triangulate yourself—involving third parties in conflicts rather than addressing people directly.

You may struggle to have relationships without competition, ranking, or drama.

This isn't your fault. It's what you learned. But awareness allows something different.

**Decoding your role**

Ask yourself:

- Which role did I play in my family?
- How does that role show up in my current relationships?
- What did that role cost me?
- What might it mean to step out of that role?

You may have played multiple roles, or shifted between them. The key is recognizing the patterns so they become choices rather than compulsions.

**In our next lesson,** we'll look specifically at parental wounds—what happens when your parent is the narcissist, and how those early experiences shape everything that follows.

## Exercise

**Family Role Inventory**

**Part 1: Your Role(s)**

For each role, rate how present it was in your childhood (0 = not at all, 5 = primary role):

| Role | Rating | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Golden Child | /5 | |
| Scapegoat | /5 | |
| Invisible Child | /5 | |
| Caretaker/Fixer | /5 | |

Did your role shift? When and why?

**Part 2: Triangulation Patterns**

Check patterns you experienced:
- [ ] Children played against each other
- [ ] Used as messenger between parents
- [ ] Loyalty tests between family members
- [ ] Recipient of inappropriate parental confiding
- [ ] Others (describe):

**Part 3: Current Impact**

1. How does your childhood role show up in your adult relationships?
2. Do you automatically take a certain position in groups?
3. Do you triangulate in your own relationships?

**Part 4: Breaking the Pattern**

What would it look like to choose your role rather than default to the assigned one?
