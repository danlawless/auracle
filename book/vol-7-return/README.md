# The Return

## Volume 7: Money, Work & Building a Life After Survival Mode

> *A Guide for Those Ready to Thrive, Not Just Survive*

---

## ⚡ The Vision

This volume addresses the practical rebuilding that follows emotional healing. Financial abuse, career derailment, and scarcity mindset are embedded in most narcissistic dynamics — but rarely addressed in recovery literature.

You've done the inner work. Now it's time to build the outer life.

**Core insight:** *"You are allowed to thrive, not just survive."*
