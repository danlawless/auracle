# Appendix C: Scripts & Phrases

## Clean Language for Boundaries, Intimacy, and Leadership

These scripts are templates. Adapt them to your voice and context.

The goal is not to sound scripted—it's to have words ready when you need them. Practice saying these out loud until they feel natural.

---

## How to Use These Scripts

1. **Read them out loud.** Notice which feel natural and which feel awkward.
2. **Adapt to your voice.** Change words while keeping the structure.
3. **Practice before you need them.** Rehearse in low-stakes moments so they're available in high-stakes ones.
4. **Start simple.** Use the shortest version that works.
5. **No explanation required.** These are complete sentences. You don't need to add justification.
6. **Pause after speaking.** Let the script land. Don't fill the silence.

## Closing Notes

These scripts are training wheels. Use them until you don't need them.

The goal is embodied language—words that arise naturally from your grounded state. Until that's reliable, scripts help bridge the gap.

**Remember:**
- You don't need to be perfect
- You can stumble and still hold your boundary
- Saying it imperfectly is better than not saying it
- The other person's reaction is theirs to manage

*"My body knows. My job is to honor what it tells me."*
