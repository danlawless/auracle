# Appendix E: Glossary of Terms

## Key Concepts and Definitions

---

This glossary defines the key terms used throughout this book. Understanding this vocabulary helps you name what you've experienced and communicate about it with others. Language is power—when you can name something, it loses some of its hold over you.

---

## A

### Abuse Amnesia
The phenomenon where victims of abuse forget or minimize past abusive incidents, often remembering only the "good times." This is partly due to trauma's effect on memory and partly due to cognitive dissonance. Abusers often exploit this by referencing a rosy shared past that minimizes the harm.

### Ambient Abuse
Subtle, hard-to-identify abuse that creates a constant atmosphere of anxiety without specific incidents to point to. Examples include sighing, eye-rolling, "forgetting" important things, chronic lateness, and other behaviors that individually seem minor but collectively create an oppressive environment.

### Attachment Style
Patterns of relating to others in close relationships, formed in early childhood. The four main styles are: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant, and fearful-avoidant. Understanding your attachment style can help explain vulnerability to certain relationship patterns.

---

## B

### Baiting
Deliberately provoking someone to get an emotional reaction, which can then be used against them. Examples: bringing up sensitive topics, making subtle insults, or creating situations designed to trigger jealousy or anger.

### Blame-Shifting
Deflecting responsibility for one's behavior by redirecting focus to the victim. Instead of addressing their own actions, the narcissist makes the conversation about something the victim did wrong.

### Boundaries
Limits you set to protect your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual wellbeing. Healthy boundaries define what you will and won't accept in relationships. Narcissists typically resist, test, and violate boundaries.

### Breadcrumbing
Giving someone just enough attention or affection to keep them interested without any intention of following through. Like leaving a trail of breadcrumbs that leads nowhere.

---

## C

### Circular Conversation
A discussion that goes round and round without resolution. The narcissist uses deflection, word salad, blame-shifting, and topic changes to prevent any productive outcome. You end up exhausted and confused, having resolved nothing.

### Closure
The sense of resolution and understanding at the end of a relationship or situation. Narcissists typically deny closure, leaving things unresolved as a way to maintain connection and control.

### Coercive Control
A pattern of controlling behaviors that create an environment of fear and dependency. May include isolation, financial control, monitoring activities, making threats, and other tactics that limit the victim's freedom and autonomy.

### Cognitive Dissonance
The mental discomfort of holding two conflicting beliefs simultaneously. In narcissistic abuse, this often manifests as struggling to reconcile the loving person you believed existed with the harmful behavior you're experiencing.

### Compartmentalization
Separating different aspects of life or self to avoid the discomfort of contradiction. Narcissists compartmentalize to maintain their different "masks." Victims compartmentalize to survive cognitive dissonance.

### Complex PTSD (C-PTSD)
A form of PTSD that develops from prolonged, repeated trauma, often in situations where escape is difficult. Common in survivors of ongoing abuse. Symptoms include emotional flashbacks, difficulty regulating emotions, negative self-perception, and relationship difficulties.

### Conditioning
The process by which behavior is modified through repeated associations. In abusive relationships, victims become conditioned to accept treatment, suppress reactions, or respond in specific ways through repeated patterns of reward and punishment.

### Covert Narcissist
A narcissist whose traits are less obvious and more hidden. Rather than grandiose displays, covert narcissists often present as shy, victimized, or self-deprecating, while still maintaining the core narcissistic traits of entitlement and lack of empathy.

---

## D

### DARVO
Acronym for Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. A manipulation tactic where the abuser denies the abuse, attacks the victim for bringing it up, and then claims to be the real victim.

### Devalue
The second phase of the narcissistic abuse cycle (after idealization). During devaluation, the narcissist begins criticizing, withdrawing affection, and treating the victim as inferior after initially putting them on a pedestal.

### Discard
The third phase of the narcissistic abuse cycle. The narcissist abruptly ends the relationship, often cruelly and without explanation, leaving the victim confused and devastated. May be followed by hoovering.

### Dissociation
A disconnection from your thoughts, feelings, surroundings, or sense of identity. A protective response to overwhelming stress or trauma. Can range from mild "zoning out" to more severe forms of disconnection from reality.

### Double Bind
A situation where no response is correct—you're wrong if you do and wrong if you don't. Creates a sense of helplessness and confusion. Example: Being criticized for being "too emotional" when upset but "cold" when calm.

---

## E

### Emotional Flashback
A sudden regression to the emotional state of a past trauma, without necessarily having visual memories. You may suddenly feel small, helpless, or terrified without fully understanding why. Common in C-PTSD.

### Emotional Incest (Covert Incest)
A dynamic where a parent inappropriately relies on a child for emotional support typically expected from an adult partner. While not sexual, it violates emotional boundaries and can cause lasting damage.

### Empathy
The ability to understand and share the feelings of another. Narcissists have impaired empathy—they may intellectually understand emotions but don't feel them the way others do.

### Enabler
Someone who facilitates the narcissist's behavior, often unintentionally. May make excuses for them, pressure victims to "keep the peace," or fail to acknowledge the abuse.

### Enmeshment
An unhealthy closeness where boundaries between individuals are blurred. Often seen in families where members are not allowed to have separate identities, opinions, or lives.

---

## F

### False Self
The constructed persona a narcissist presents to the world. Designed to gain admiration and hide their true feelings of inadequacy. The "mask" they wear in public.

### FLEAS
Maladaptive behaviors picked up from living with a personality-disordered individual. Not full-blown narcissism, but unhealthy patterns learned from exposure. Named from the saying "lie down with dogs, wake up with fleas."

### Flying Monkeys
People who do the narcissist's bidding, often without realizing they're being manipulated. Named after the Wicked Witch's minions in The Wizard of Oz. They may spread gossip, apply pressure, or gather information on the narcissist's behalf.

### FOG
Acronym for Fear, Obligation, and Guilt—the three emotions narcissists use to manipulate and control their victims.

### Future Faking
Making promises about the future with no intention of following through. Used during love-bombing to create investment and hope. Examples: talk of marriage, vacations, moving in together, or life changes that never materialize.

---

## G

### Gaslighting
A manipulation tactic that makes someone question their own reality, memory, and perceptions. Named after the 1944 film "Gaslight." Examples: denying things that happened, calling you crazy or too sensitive, rearranging facts until you doubt yourself.

### Golden Child
In narcissistic family systems, the child who is idealized and favored by the narcissistic parent. May become a narcissist themselves or struggle with perfectionism and identity issues.

### Gray Rock Method
A technique for dealing with narcissists where you become as boring and unresponsive as a gray rock. Giving minimal emotional reactions and keeping conversations brief and dull.

### Grandiosity
An inflated sense of self-importance characteristic of narcissism. The belief that one is special, superior, or deserving of special treatment.

### Grooming
The process of building trust and emotional connection for the purpose of manipulation or abuse. Can occur over weeks, months, or years before abuse becomes apparent.

---

## H

### Hoovering
Attempts to suck a victim back into a relationship after a discard or when they try to leave. Named after the vacuum cleaner. May include love-bombing, false apologies, threats, or playing victim.

### Hypervigilance
A state of increased alertness and sensitivity to potential threats. Common in trauma survivors. In relationships, manifests as constantly scanning for mood changes or signs of impending conflict.

---

## I

### Idealization
The first phase of the narcissistic abuse cycle. The narcissist puts the victim on a pedestal, showering them with attention, affection, and admiration. Creates the "high" that the victim later chases.

### Identified Patient
In family therapy, the family member who is blamed for the family's problems. In narcissistic families, often the scapegoat is treated as the "problem" while the real dysfunction is ignored.

### Intermittent Reinforcement
An unpredictable pattern of reward and punishment that creates powerful psychological bonding. The inconsistency creates hope and addiction similar to gambling.

### Invalidation
Dismissing, ignoring, or rejecting someone's thoughts, feelings, or experiences. A core tactic of emotional abuse that erodes self-trust.

Overwhelming someone with excessive affection, attention, and admiration, especially early in a relationship. Used to quickly establish connection and dependency. Often too much, too soon.

### Low Contact
Maintaining minimal necessary contact with a narcissist when no contact isn't possible (such as with co-parents or family members). Involves strict boundaries and limited communication.

---

## M

### Manipulation
Using indirect, deceptive, or underhanded tactics to control or influence others for one's own benefit.

### Masking
The act of hiding one's true self or feelings. Narcissists mask their true nature to appear charming. Victims mask to avoid triggering the narcissist or to survive in the relationship.

### Mirroring
Reflecting someone's behaviors, preferences, or values back to them. Narcissists use mirroring during love-bombing to appear as the perfect partner.

### Moving Goalposts
Constantly changing expectations or criteria for success so that the victim can never meet them. No matter what they do, it's never enough.

A narcissist whose traits are obvious and grandiose. They openly seek admiration, display arrogance, and behave in obviously entitled ways.

---

The part of yourself that developed survival strategies to cope with abuse. May include hypervigilance, people-pleasing, or emotional numbing. Important to honor even while outgrowing these patterns.

### Proxy Recruitment
Enlisting others to do your work of manipulation, abuse, or control. The people recruited (flying monkeys) may not realize they're being used.

---

## R

### Reactive Abuse
When a victim of sustained abuse finally reacts with anger, tears, or behavior that can then be used against them. The abuser provokes a reaction and then points to it as evidence that the victim is the problem.

### Reality Testing
The practice of checking your perceptions against outside sources to counter gaslighting effects. May include journaling, consulting trusted friends, or reviewing documentation.

### Reparenting
The process of providing yourself the nurturing, validation, and care you didn't receive as a child. Often part of healing from narcissistic family dynamics.
