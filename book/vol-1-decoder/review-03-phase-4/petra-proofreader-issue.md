## Direct Corrections (No Author Decision Needed)

These corrections can be applied immediately:

### Correction 1: Front Matter Hotline Number

**Location:** `00-front-matter.md`, Line 25

**Current:**
```markdown
- National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233 (24/7)
```

**Change to:**
```markdown
- National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233
```

**Reason:** Style sheet indicates hotline numbers should not have additional descriptive text in parentheses.

---

### Correction 2: Chapter 13 Hotline Number

**Location:** `chapters/13-exposure-questions.md`, Line 16

**Current:**
```markdown
> - Contact: National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233 (24/7)
```

**Change to:**
```markdown
> - Contact: National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233
```

**Reason:** Same style consistency issue as Correction 1.

---

### Correction 3: README Chapter Title Mismatch

**Location:** `README.md`, Line 93

**Current:**
```markdown
**[Chapter 13: Diagnostic Questions](./chapters/13-exposure-questions.md)**
```

**Change to:**
```markdown
**[Chapter 13: The Exposure Questions](./chapters/13-exposure-questions.md)**
```

**Reason:** The actual chapter title is "The Exposure Questions." The README uses outdated title.

---

## Questions for Author Decision (5 Questions)

### Q1: Chapter 5 Redundant Subtitle

**Location:** `chapters/05-narcissist-types.md`, Lines 1-2

**Current:**
```markdown
# Chapter 5: Understanding Narcissist Types

## Understanding the Different Faces of Narcissism
```

Both use "Understanding" and both refer to the same concept.

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Repetition is intentional for rhythm/emphasis — keep as-is
- [ ] B) Change subtitle to "The Different Faces of Narcissism"
- [ ] C) Change subtitle to different concept (e.g., "The Spectrum from Grandiose to Covert")
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

---

### Q2: Hotline Number Formatting Consistency

**Current practice varies:**
- Front matter line 25: `1-800-799-7233 (24/7)` — has descriptor
- Chapter 13 line 16: `1-800-799-7233 (24/7)` — has descriptor
- Appendix A line 19: `1-800-799-7233 (TTY: 1-800-787-3224)` — has TTY, no 24/7
- README line 50: `1-800-799-7233 (24/7, confidential)` — has both descriptors

**Question:** Should the manuscript adopt a single consistent format for all hotline number references?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Remove all parenthetical descriptors (cleanest)
- [ ] B) Include TTY numbers where relevant but remove time/availability descriptors
- [ ] C) Keep everything as-is (variation is intentional by context)
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

---

### Q3: Crisis Resource Formatting Variations

Crisis resources appear in different formats:
1. Front matter: Simple bullet list
2. Chapter 13: Table format with safety level descriptions
3. Appendix A: Comprehensive table with TTY and international resources
4. README: Simple list format

**Question:** Are these intentional variations based on context, or should formatting be standardized?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Intentional variation by location — keep as-is
- [ ] B) Standardize to simple list format throughout
- [ ] C) Standardize to table format throughout
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

---

### Q4: Em Dash Spacing in Appendix C

**Status check:** Round 2 identified "12 instances" of spaced em dashes in Appendix C. Current review found no spaced em dashes — all appear correctly formatted.

**Question:** Was this issue already corrected between Round 2 and Round 3?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Yes, already corrected — no action needed
- [ ] B) Not corrected — provide specific line numbers
- [ ] C) Other: _____________

---

### Q5: Publication Readiness Confirmation

**Question:** Are there any known issues or planned changes that should be addressed before final publication?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) No — proceed to publication after these corrections
- [ ] B) Yes — additional items: _____________

## Petra's Final Assessment

This manuscript is **exceptionally well-edited**. The progression from Round 1 (11 errors) to Round 2 (79+ errors — due to systematic review) to Round 3 (7 minor items) shows systematic improvement.

The remaining items are:
- 3 minor formatting consistencies (seconds to fix)
- 4 style questions (author preference decisions)

**Recommendation:** Make the 3 direct corrections, resolve the 4 author questions, and this volume is ready for publication.
