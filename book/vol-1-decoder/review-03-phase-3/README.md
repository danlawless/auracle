# Phase 3: Polish Review

**Volume:** Vol. 1: The Narcissism Decoder
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Date Initiated:** January 4, 2026

---

## Phase 3 Overview

Phase 3 focuses on **prose polish and copy editing** now that Phase 1 structural decisions and Phase 2 content decisions are complete. Two reviewers work sequentially:

| Order | Reviewer | Role | Questions | Focus |
|-------|----------|------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | **Lydia** | Line Editor | 18 | Prose craft, voice, rhythm, word choice |
| 2 | **Clara** | Copy Editor | 28 | Style consistency, terminology, formatting |

**Total Phase 3 Questions: 46**

---

## Why Sequential Order Matters

Unlike Phase 2 (where reviewers addressed independent concerns), Phase 3 reviewers must work in order:

1. **Lydia (Line Editor) first** — addresses prose-level refinements
2. **Clara (Copy Editor) second** — ensures style consistency after line edits

Line editing changes can affect copy editing decisions, so Lydia's questions should be resolved before Clara's.

## Question Priority Guidance

### Lydia (Line Editor) — 18 Questions

**High Priority:**
- Q1-Q3 (Voice consistency) — affects overall manuscript feel
- Q8 (Em-dash frequency) — affects reading rhythm throughout

**Medium Priority:**
- Q4-Q5 (Rhythm/structure) — chapter-specific refinements
- Q6-Q7 (Word choice) — stylistic preferences
- Q11-Q12 (Transitions) — chapter endings

**Reflection Questions:**
- Q9-Q10 (Metaphor usage) — understanding intentional choices
- Q13-Q18 (Stylistic patterns) — confirming what's working

### Clara (Copy Editor) — 28 Questions

**Priority Level 1 (Affects Multiple Chapters):**
- Numbers in titles/headers — framework exception clarification
- Research note/disclaimer formatting
- Field note labeling consistency
- Pronoun variation audit

**Priority Level 2 (Style Consistency):**
- Gray Rock capitalization rule
- Parenthetical vs. footnote style
- Pause point formatting
- Decoder card numbering confirmation

**Priority Level 3 (Clarification/Verification):**
- Volume reference spot-check
- Terminology distinctions
- Complex sections clarity
- Table formatting for publication

---

## Timeline Expectation

Phase 3 can be completed in 1-2 sessions. Many questions confirm intentional choices rather than request changes.

**Recommended approach:**
1. Review Lydia's questions first (prose-level)
2. Answer obvious/quick decisions immediately
3. Mark questions needing reflection
4. Then proceed to Clara's questions (style-level)

---

## What Happens After Phase 3

Once Phase 3 is complete:

1. **Implement approved changes** from Lydia and Clara responses
2. **Update style sheet** based on author decisions
3. **Move to Phase 4:** Final proofreading (Petra)
4. **Publication ready** after Phase 4 completion
