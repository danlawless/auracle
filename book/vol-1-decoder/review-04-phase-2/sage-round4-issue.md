## Overview

Hi again! I'm Sage, returning for Round 4 to verify that the Phase 2 representation and inclusion improvements were properly implemented.

**My focus this round:** Confirm that my 18 Round 3 recommendations were executed authentically and respectfully.

## Implementations to Verify

### 1. Dissociation Caveat (Q1 Response)

**What was requested:** Add acknowledgment for survivors who struggle to access body signals due to dissociation.

**Implementation found:** Chapter 2, lines 37-38:
> "A note on dissociation: If you struggle to feel your body's signals—if there's numbness, blankness, or a sense of being 'above' your body—that's a trauma response too. Your body learned to go quiet to survive. That disconnection is information, not a failure."

**Verification Questions:**

**V1: Dissociation Caveat Authenticity**
- [ ] A) Language is validating and accurate
- [ ] B) Language could be more validating—suggest: _____________
- [ ] C) Language is too clinical—warm it up
- [ ] D) Add mention of professional support: _____________
- [ ] E) Other feedback: _____________

**V2: Dissociation Caveat Placement**
- [ ] A) Placement within First Aid box is appropriate
- [ ] B) Should be more prominent (separate section)
- [ ] C) Should appear earlier in chapter
- [ ] D) Other placement feedback: _____________

---

### 2. Neurodivergence Acknowledgment (Q2 Response)

**What was requested:** Add acknowledgment that "too sensitive" label may have been weaponized against neurodivergent traits.

**Verification Questions:**

**V3: Neurodivergence Integration**
- [ ] A) Neurodivergence is acknowledged appropriately
- [ ] B) Need explicit mention in Chapter 2 body awareness section
- [ ] C) Need explicit mention in "too sensitive" reclamation sections
- [ ] D) Current level of acknowledgment is sufficient
- [ ] E) Other feedback: _____________

---

### 3. Terminology Note (Q4 Response)

**What was requested:** Add note distinguishing behavioral patterns from clinical NPD diagnosis.

**Implementation found:** Front matter, "A Note on Diagnosis and Terminology" (lines 269-279):
> "This book does not diagnose anyone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)... When we say 'narcissist' in these pages, we mean someone who consistently exhibits these patterns, not necessarily someone with a clinical diagnosis... 'Narcissist' here refers to patterns of behavior, not a fixed identity. People can change."

**Verification Questions:**

**V4: Terminology Note Completeness**
- [ ] A) Note adequately distinguishes patterns from diagnosis
- [ ] B) Note should acknowledge NPD as treatable: _____________
- [ ] C) Note should address potential stigma more directly
- [ ] D) Note is well-balanced as written
- [ ] E) Other feedback: _____________

---

### 4. Western Perspective Acknowledgment (Q10-12 Responses)

**What was requested:** Strengthen acknowledgment of Western/individualist framework and limitations for collectivist cultures.

**Implementation found:** Front matter, "A Note on Diversity and Access" (lines 254-264):
> "This book speaks from a Western, individualist perspective. Readers in collectivist cultures may need to adapt 'leaving' strategies to 'boundary-within-family' approaches. Religious communities where divorce is stigmatized, cultures where family estrangement carries severe social consequences, and communities where communication norms differ all deserve acknowledgment."

**Verification Questions:**

**V5: Cultural Acknowledgment Adequacy**
- [ ] A) Acknowledgment is respectful and sufficient
- [ ] B) Need more specific guidance for collectivist readers
- [ ] C) Acknowledgment should appear in additional locations
- [ ] D) Low-contact/gray rock strategies need expansion
- [ ] E) Other feedback: _____________

---

### 5. Race and Intersectionality Acknowledgment (Q16 Response)

**What was requested:** Add acknowledgment of what's not covered regarding race and intersectionality.

**Implementation found:** Front matter (lines 257-259):
> "This book doesn't fully address how race, class, disability, and other identities intersect with narcissistic abuse. BIPOC survivors may face additional gaslighting about their experiences, may encounter racial dynamics within abusive relationships, and may find mainstream resources less culturally attuned. These intersections deserve dedicated treatment beyond what this book provides."

**Verification Questions:**

**V6: Intersectionality Acknowledgment**
- [ ] A) Acknowledgment is honest and appropriate
- [ ] B) Should include more specific BIPOC resources
- [ ] C) Language should be adjusted: _____________
- [ ] D) Acknowledgment is sufficient
- [ ] E) Other feedback: _____________

---

### 6. Healing Accessibility Note (Q15 Response)

**What was requested:** Add note about healing resources not requiring financial privilege.

**Implementation found:** Front matter, "A Note on Access and Privilege" (lines 282-289):
> "This book provides tools that don't require financial privilege—many techniques need only your attention and time: grounding practices, journaling, body awareness, and the 3-3-3 rule cost nothing."

**Verification Questions:**

**V7: Accessibility Note**
- [ ] A) Note appropriately addresses economic barriers
- [ ] B) Note should be more prominent
- [ ] C) Need additional free resource suggestions
- [ ] D) Note is well-placed and sufficient
- [ ] E) Other feedback: _____________

---

**What was requested:** Add note about potential for material to be misused/weaponized.

**Verification Questions:**

**V8: Weaponization Warning Presence**
- [ ] A) Warning is present and well-placed
- [ ] B) Warning needs to be added—suggest location: _____________
