# Chapter 15: The Grief That Follows Freedom

## Navigating the Waves of Loss

---

*She set the boundary. She stopped calling. She moved out, moved on, moved forward.*

*Everyone told her she should feel free. Lighter. Relieved.*

*Instead, she felt hollow. Some mornings, she woke up crying without knowing why. Some evenings, she missed the very things that had hurt her.*

*She wondered if she'd made a mistake. If freedom was supposed to feel this empty.*

*What no one told her: grief comes after freedom. Not instead of it—after it. The leaving is one thing. The grieving is another.*

## Field Note: The Unexpected Heaviness

Six months after going no-contact with her mother, she thought she'd feel lighter.

Instead, she felt heavier than ever.

Not because she regretted the decision—but because the decision made space for all the grief she'd been outrunning for decades.

She wasn't just grieving her mother. She was grieving the mother she'd never had. The childhood she'd missed. The version of herself that might have existed if things had been different.

Her therapist said: "You're not falling apart. You're finally having room to feel what was always there."

That was the thing about freedom. It didn't just release you from the bad. It released everything.

## What You're Actually Grieving

When healing from narcissistic dynamics, trauma bonds, and dysregulated families, you may grieve:

**The relationship itself:**
- What it was (even the good parts)
- What it could have been
- What you hoped it would become

**The person you loved:**
- The version of them you believed in
- The potential you saw
- The moments of genuine connection (they were real, even if inconsistent)

**The family you deserved:**
- The parents who could have been present
- The childhood that could have been safe
- The foundation you didn't receive

**Your lost years:**
- Time spent in the pattern
- Opportunities missed
- Energy devoted to something that couldn't change

**Your lost self:**
- Who you were before
- Who you might have been
- The parts you suppressed to survive

**The fantasy:**
- The hope that kept you going
- The future you imagined
- The story you told yourself

All of this is real loss. It deserves to be grieved.

## Why Grief Is Necessary

Many people try to skip grief. They want to go straight from awareness to healing, from understanding to freedom.

But grief is not an obstacle to healing—it's part of it.

**Without grief:**
- You stay attached to what you're leaving
- Anger becomes bitterness
- Sadness becomes depression
- The loss stays unprocessed

**With grief:**
- You release what you're leaving
- Anger becomes clarity
- Sadness moves through
- The loss integrates

Grief is not a detour. It's the path.

## Neuroscience Lens: How Grief Heals

Grief isn't just emotional—it's neurological.

**What happens when you grieve:**

When you allow yourself to grieve, your brain engages in a process called *memory reconsolidation*. The neural pathways associated with the loss are activated and then updated with new information—namely, that the loss is real and you survived it.

**The chemistry of grief:**

- **Cortisol** initially spikes (stress response to loss)
- **Oxytocin** is released through social support and self-compassion
- **Endorphins** help manage emotional pain
- **Dopamine** gradually rebalances as you find new sources of meaning

**Why suppressed grief persists:**

When grief is suppressed, the neural networks associated with the loss remain active but unprocessed. The brain keeps treating the loss as an open file—something unresolved that needs attention. This is why ungrieved losses keep surfacing.

**How grief completes:**

Grief completes when the brain updates its internal model of reality. The person or relationship moves from "present" to "past." This doesn't mean forgetting—it means integrating.

## The Stages (Not Linear)

You may experience:

**Denial:**
"It wasn't that bad."
"Maybe I'm overreacting."
"Maybe they'll change."

**Anger:**
"How could they?"
"It's not fair."
"I wasted so much time."

**Bargaining:**
"Maybe if I had..."
"What if I try one more time?"
"If I explain it differently..."

**Depression:**
"What's the point?"
"I'm too tired."
"This is too hard."

**Acceptance:**
"It was what it was."
"I'm choosing differently now."
"I can hold the pain and keep moving."

These don't happen in order. You'll cycle through them, sometimes in a single day. That's normal.

## Grief Comes in Waves

Grief doesn't arrive once and leave. It comes in waves.

**What to expect:**
- Some days you'll feel fine, even hopeful
- Other days, the sadness will ambush you
- Triggers can bring it back suddenly
- Holidays, anniversaries, and transitions often intensify it

**How to ride the waves:**
1. Don't fight them
2. Let the feeling move through
3. Ground when overwhelmed
4. Know that waves pass

The waves get smaller over time. They may never fully stop—but they become manageable.

---

## Practice: Riding the Grief Wave

*When grief arrives unexpectedly*

**Step 1: Acknowledge**
Say to yourself: "This is grief. It's here."

Don't fight it. Don't analyze it. Just name it.

**Step 2: Ground**
- Feel your feet on the floor
- Notice your breath
- Touch something solid
- Look around and name what you see

**Step 3: Allow**
Give the wave permission to move through you. Set a timer for 5-10 minutes if needed.

Say: "I can feel this for a few minutes."

**Step 4: Release**
When the intensity passes, take three deep breaths.

Say: "That was grief. It moved through. I'm still here."

**Step 5: Return**
Do something small and grounding—drink water, step outside, touch something soft.

**The practice is not about stopping grief. It's about letting it move.**

## Complicated Grief

Grief after narcissistic relationships or dysfunctional families is often complicated by:

**Ambivalence:**
You love someone who hurt you. Both feelings are real.

**Lack of validation:**
Others may not understand your grief. "But they seemed so nice."

**Ongoing contact:**
If the person is still alive and in your life, you may grieve while still in the relationship.

**No closure:**
You may never get the conversation or acknowledgment you need.

**Disenfranchised grief:**
Society doesn't recognize some losses (living estrangement, for example) as "real" grief.

All of this makes the grief harder—but not less valid.

---

## Allowing Grief

Give yourself permission to:

- Cry (even if you haven't cried in years)
- Be angry (even if it feels "unspiritual")
- Miss them (even if they hurt you)
- Mourn the fantasy (even if it was never real)
- Take time (grief doesn't have a schedule)

You don't need to justify your grief. You just need to let it move.

---

## Practice: Grief Rituals

Rituals can help process grief that words can't reach.

**Writing:**
- Write a letter you won't send
- Write what you wish you could say
- Write what you wish they had said

**Ceremony:**
- Light a candle for what you're releasing
- Burn a written goodbye
- Create a small altar to honor the transition

**Body:**
- Move the grief through exercise
- Let the body cry, shake, or release
- Take long walks in nature

**Symbol:**
- Choose an object that represents the relationship
- Decide what to do with it (keep, release, transform)
- Let the action be meaningful

## When Grief Gets Stuck

Sometimes grief doesn't move. Signs of stuck grief:

- Numbness that persists
- Inability to talk about it at all
- Chronic low-grade depression
- Avoiding all reminders
- Grief that intensifies rather than softens over time

If grief feels stuck, consider:
- Working with a grief-informed therapist
- Somatic approaches (EMDR, somatic experiencing)
- Support groups for similar losses
- More structured grief rituals

Stuck grief isn't failure—it's a sign that more support is needed.

## Practice: The Grief Inventory

*A writing practice for when grief feels stuck*

Take time with each prompt. Write without editing.

**What I lost:**
(List everything—the obvious and the hidden)

**What I never had:**
(What you grieved before you even left)

**What I wish had happened:**
(The fantasy you're releasing)

**What I'm angry about:**
(Let yourself name it without censoring)

**What I'm grateful survived:**
(Parts of yourself that made it through)

**What I'm ready to release:**
(What you no longer want to carry)

After writing, you can keep these words, burn them, or bury them. The ritual is yours to design.

---

## Grief and Gratitude

Eventually—not immediately, not forced—you may find:

- Gratitude for your own resilience
- Gratitude for the lessons (even the painful ones)
- Gratitude for who you're becoming
- Compassion for all involved (including yourself)

This doesn't mean the pain was worth it. It means you're integrating it.

Don't rush to gratitude. But know it often comes.

---

## The Grief Beneath Hope

Often, hope is a protective layer over grief.

As long as you hope, you don't have to fully feel the loss. Hope keeps a door open—and that open door keeps you from feeling the finality of what is.

Part of releasing unhealthy hope is being willing to grieve.

**The grief says:**
- This relationship is not what I wanted it to be
- They may never change
- I may never get what I needed
- This door may be closed forever
- I cannot make them see me
- I cannot love them into health
- My hope doesn't change their capacity

Feeling that grief is not giving up. It's integrating reality.

## Reader Reflection

What losses are you still carrying that need to be grieved?

What grief have you been avoiding by staying hopeful?

What would it mean to let yourself fully feel the loss?

What ritual might help you honor what you're releasing?
