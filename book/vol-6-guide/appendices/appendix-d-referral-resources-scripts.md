# Appendix D: Referral Resources & Scripts

## Knowing When and How to Pass the Baton

---

One of the most important skills in helping work is knowing when to stop.

Not because you've failed. Because you care enough to recognize that someone else can serve them better.

Referral is not abandonment. It's discernment.

This appendix will help you recognize when to refer, how to do it with care, and what to say in the process.

---

## Part I: Why Referral Matters

### The Limits of Any Helper

No one can help everyone. Every helper has:

**Scope limitations:** What you're trained or qualified to address
**Capacity limitations:** How much you can hold at any given time
**Expertise limitations:** What you know deeply versus superficially
**Personal limitations:** Where your own material interferes
**Modality limitations:** What your approach can and cannot do

*Referral is not failure. It's integrity.*

### The Harm of Not Referring

When you try to help beyond your scope:
- The client doesn't get what they actually need
- Progress stalls or reverses
- You burn out holding what isn't yours to hold
- Trust erodes when they sense the mismatch
- You carry guilt and anxiety
- Harm can occur—sometimes serious harm

### The Gift of Good Referral

When you refer well:
- The client gets matched to the right resource
- Their trust in the helping profession increases
- You model healthy limits
- You protect your capacity for others
- The relationship can continue in appropriate form
- Everyone's time is used wisely

## Part II: When to Refer

### Category 1: Scope of Practice

**Refer when the issue is outside what you're trained to address.**

| If You Are | Refer When |
|------------|-----------|
| Coach | Mental health symptoms arise (depression, anxiety, trauma) |
| Life coach | They need career-specific guidance |
| Therapist | They need medication evaluation |
| Therapist | They need specialized treatment you don't offer (EMDR, eating disorders, OCD) |
| Content creator | They're in acute crisis |
| Spiritual guide | They need mental health treatment |
| Body worker | Psychological trauma is emerging |
| Peer support | They need professional treatment |

**The principle:** Stay in your lane. Know where your lane ends.

---

### Category 2: Beyond Your Expertise

**Refer when someone else knows this territory better than you.**

Examples:
- A specific presenting issue you've never worked with
- A population you don't have experience with
- A modality they specifically need
- A cultural or identity context you're not qualified to address
- A legal or medical situation

**The principle:** There's no shame in saying, "Someone else is better suited for this."

---

### Category 3: Personal Limitations

**Refer when your own material interferes with your effectiveness.**

This includes:
- The client triggers your trauma repeatedly
- You've developed feelings that compromise objectivity
- Their situation is too close to your own
- You find yourself avoiding or dreading them
- You can't be neutral about their decisions
- Dual relationship complications

**The principle:** If you can't be clear, clean help, you're not the right helper.

---

### Category 4: Capacity Limitations

**Refer when you're at or beyond capacity.**

Signs:
- Caseload is full
- You're burnt out
- You can't give them adequate attention
- Taking them on would compromise care for others
- You're accepting clients to fill a need in you, not them

**The principle:** A helper at capacity is not actually helpful.

---

### Category 5: Safety Concerns

**Refer (or add resources) when safety is at stake.**

Situations requiring immediate specialized response:
- Active suicidal ideation with plan
- Self-harm behavior
- Eating disorders at dangerous levels
- Psychosis
- Domestic violence requiring safety planning
- Substance abuse requiring detox
- Child abuse (reporting obligations)
- Homicidal ideation

**The principle:** Safety takes priority. Get appropriate resources involved.

---

### Category 6: Lack of Progress

**Consider referral when the work isn't working.**

Signs:
- Same issues, session after session, without movement
- Interventions that helped others aren't landing
- A mismatch between your modality and their needs
- Their needs have evolved beyond what you offer
- The therapeutic relationship isn't generative

**The principle:** Sometimes the most helpful thing is admitting the match isn't right.

---

### Category 7: Ethical Concerns

**Refer when continuing would compromise ethics.**

Examples:
- Dual relationships that can't be resolved
- Attraction that's affecting your judgment
- The dynamic has become harmful
- You've recognized you're in shadow helper patterns with this person
- Continuing would serve your needs more than theirs

**The principle:** Ethical practice sometimes means letting go.

---

## Part III: Types of Referral

### Full Referral (Transfer of Care)

You're ending your work with them, and they'll continue with someone else.

**Use when:**
- The issue is completely outside your scope
- The therapeutic relationship is compromised
- They need a level of care you can't provide
- You're leaving practice or moving

### Adjunct Referral (Adding Resources)

They continue with you AND add another resource.

**Use when:**
- They need specialized treatment alongside your work
- They need medication evaluation
- They need support between sessions
- They need a different modality for a specific issue
- You want to address one piece while someone else addresses another

### Consultation Referral (One-Time Check)

You're referring for evaluation or consultation, not ongoing treatment.

**Use when:**
- You need diagnostic clarity
- They need a medical evaluation
- You want a second opinion
- A specific question needs expert input

### Warm Handoff vs. Cold Referral

**Warm handoff:** You personally connect them to the new provider
- Call ahead
- Send relevant information (with consent)
- Follow up to ensure connection happened

**Cold referral:** You give them resources to contact
- Provide a list of providers
- Give general information about accessing care
- They do the reaching out

*Warm handoffs are more effective for vulnerable clients who might not follow through.*

---

## Part IV: How to Refer Well

### Step 1: Prepare Yourself

Before the conversation:
- Get clear on why you're referring
- Have referral resources ready
- Anticipate their reactions
- Prepare your language
- Process any guilt or reluctance in supervision

### Step 2: Frame It as Care

Referral should not feel like rejection. Frame it as:
- An act of care, not abandonment
- Getting them the best possible help
- Matching resources to needs
- Your ethical responsibility
- Expansion, not ending

### Step 3: Be Direct and Clear

Don't bury the message or over-explain. State clearly:
- What you're recommending
- Why you're recommending it
- What will happen next
- That this isn't their fault
- That you'll support the transition

### Step 4: Hold Their Reaction

They may feel:
- Rejected
- Abandoned
- Ashamed
- Angry
- Confused
- Scared

**Your job:** Hold the reaction without retracting the referral.

### Step 5: Follow Through

- Provide actual referrals (names, numbers, information)
- Help with warm handoffs when appropriate
- Clarify what happens to your relationship
- Set a timeline for transition
- Follow up to ensure connection happened

## Part V: Scripts for Common Referral Situations

### Script 1: Scope of Practice (Coach to Therapist)

*Context: You're a coach and mental health symptoms are emerging.*

**What to say:**

*"I want to talk about something I've been noticing. The anxiety you're describing sounds like it might benefit from a different kind of support—something beyond what coaching can offer.*

*Coaching is wonderful for goals, clarity, and moving forward. But when anxiety or depression is this present, therapy offers tools and support that coaching isn't designed to provide.*

*This isn't about you doing anything wrong. It's about getting you the right support. I'd like to recommend that you connect with a therapist who specializes in anxiety. We can continue our work too, if that feels right—but I want to make sure you have what you actually need.*

*How does that land for you?"*

---

### Script 2: Personal Limitation (Trigger Overlap)

*Context: Your own material is being activated.*

**What to say:**

*"I want to be honest with you about something, because I think you deserve that honesty.*

*The work we're doing is touching on some areas that overlap with my own experience in ways that I don't think serve you well. I'm finding it harder to be as clear and neutral as you deserve.*

*This isn't about anything you've done. You've been open and brave. But I think you'd be better served by someone who can hold this space more cleanly than I can right now.*

*I want to help you find someone excellent. Would you be open to me making a referral?"*

---

### Script 3: Lack of Progress

*Context: The work isn't working.*

**What to say:**

*"I want to check in about how our work together feels to you. From my side, I'm noticing we keep circling similar ground without the movement I'd hope to see.*

*That's not a criticism of you—sometimes the match between helper and client isn't quite right, or the approach I offer isn't the best fit for what you need.*

*I'm wondering if it might be worth exploring a different approach or working with someone who specializes in [specific issue]. What are your thoughts on that?"*

---

### Script 4: Safety Concern (Need for Higher Level of Care)

*Context: Client is in crisis beyond your scope.*

**What to say:**

*"I'm hearing something in what you're sharing that I want to take seriously. When you talk about [self-harm/suicidal thoughts/specific safety issue], that tells me you might benefit from a level of support I can't provide alone.*

*This isn't about me being scared off or not wanting to work with you. It's about making sure you have the right resources. I'm thinking about [crisis services/intensive outpatient/inpatient/psychiatry].*

*I care about you, and because I care, I want to make sure you're connected to support that can meet you where you are. Can we talk about what that might look like?"*

---

### Script 5: Adjunct Referral (Adding Resources)

*Context: You want them to add therapy alongside your work.*

**What to say:**

*"Our work together has been valuable, and I want it to continue. AND I think you might benefit from adding another layer of support.*

*What you're processing around [issue] goes deep enough that having a therapist in addition to our work could really help. They could address the [trauma/mental health piece] while we continue focusing on [your specific work].*

*It's not either/or—it's both/and. What do you think?"*

---

### Script 6: Warm Handoff

*Context: You're connecting them directly to another provider.*

**What to say:**

*"I'd like to personally connect you with [Provider Name]. They specialize in [relevant specialty] and I think they'd be a great fit for what you need.*

*With your permission, I'd like to reach out to them on your behalf, give them a bit of context, and then connect the three of us. That way, you won't be starting from scratch.*

*Would that feel supportive?"*

---

### Script 7: Ending the Relationship (Full Referral)

*Context: You're ending your work together.*

**What to say:**

*"I want to talk about where we go from here. After a lot of reflection, I've come to believe that you'd be better served by working with someone else going forward.*

*I know that might be hard to hear. I want you to know: this isn't because of anything wrong with you. It's about making sure you get the best possible support.*

*I'm committed to helping you transition well. That means: [providing referrals/doing warm handoffs/having closure sessions]. We don't have to end abruptly—I want this to feel complete.*

*How are you feeling hearing this?"*

---

### Script 8: When They Resist the Referral

*Context: They don't want to be referred.*

**What to say:**

*"I can hear that this doesn't feel right to you. I understand—change is hard, especially when you've built trust here.*

*I want to explain why I'm recommending this. [Explain reason—scope, safety, match, etc.] This isn't about abandonment. It's about making sure you get what you actually need.*

*I hear your resistance, and I want to understand it better. What's coming up for you?"*

[If they still resist, but referral is essential:]

*"I hear you, and I also need to be honest: this is a boundary I'm holding for your wellbeing. I'm not going to force you to do anything. But I can't continue offering what I don't think is serving you. Let's talk about what we can do from here."*

## Part VI: Building Your Referral Network

### Types of Resources to Have Ready

| Category | Who to Know |
|----------|-------------|
| Mental health | Therapists (various specialties), psychiatrists |
| Crisis | Crisis lines, mobile crisis teams, emergency services |
| Specialized treatment | Eating disorders, addiction, trauma, OCD, etc. |
| Medical | Primary care, specialists as relevant |
| Legal | Legal aid, victim advocates |
| Financial | Financial counselors, assistance programs |
| Safety | Domestic violence resources, shelters |
| Peer support | Support groups, 12-step, peer networks |
| Coaching | Other coaches with different specialties |
| Spiritual | Chaplains, pastoral counselors, spiritual directors |

### How to Build Your Network

1. **Identify the most common referral needs** in your practice
2. **Research providers** in each category
3. **Vet them personally** when possible (meet them, see how they work)
4. **Keep organized records** of who does what
5. **Update regularly** (providers move, leave practice, fill up)
6. **Build relationships** so warm handoffs are possible

### Vetting Referral Sources

Questions to ask (or observe):
- Are they taking new clients?
- What's their specialty and approach?
- What populations do they work with?
- What are their fees and do they offer sliding scale?
- How long is their waitlist?
- What's their communication style?
- Would I want to work with them?

*You're trusting them with your clients. Make sure they're trustworthy.*

---

## Part VII: Special Considerations

### When Client Can't Afford Referral

Options to explore:
- Sliding scale providers
- Community mental health centers
- Training clinics (universities with counseling programs)
- Non-profit organizations
- Group therapy (often more affordable)
- Online therapy platforms with lower costs
- Pro-bono services
- Support groups (free)

### When Referral Isn't Available

Sometimes there's no one to refer to:
- Rural areas with limited providers
- Specific specialties not available locally
- Long waitlists everywhere
- Financial barriers insurmountable

**What to do:**
- Be honest about limitations
- Provide what you can while continuing to seek resources
- Connect with peer support options
- Consider telehealth options in other areas
- Stay in your scope—don't try to become what they need
- Document that appropriate resources aren't available

### When They're Attached to You

Highly attached clients may experience referral as abandonment.

**What helps:**
- Gradual transition when possible
- Clear explanation that it's about fit, not rejection
- Allowing grief about the ending
- Warm handoff to new provider
- Closure ritual or final session
- Leaving door open for future appropriate contact

### When You're Attached to Them

If you don't want to refer because of your attachment:
- This is a red flag (see Appendix B)
- Get supervision immediately
- The referral is even more important
- Process your attachment separately
- Don't let your needs override their needs

---

## Part VIII: After the Referral

### Following Up

- Check if they connected with the new resource
- Ask if the new resource is working (without creating competition)
- Be available for questions during transition
- Know when to step back entirely

### When the Referral Doesn't Work

Sometimes the referral doesn't take:
- They don't connect with new provider
- New provider isn't a good fit
- They keep coming back to you
- The resource wasn't what they needed

**What to do:**
- Explore what didn't work
- Offer additional options
- Reassess what they actually need
- Be honest about what you can and can't offer
- Don't take them back if it's outside your scope

### Documenting Referrals

Keep records of:
- Why you made the referral
- What you recommended
- Their response
- What resources you provided
- Follow-up steps
- Outcome (if known)

---

## Part IX: Scripts for Specific Populations

### For Clients with Trauma History (Who May Feel Abandoned)

*"I know that change has often felt like abandonment for you. That makes sense given what you've been through. I want to be really clear: this referral isn't abandonment. It's me caring enough to make sure you get what you actually need. I'm not disappearing—I'm connecting you to additional support. We can talk about what this brings up for you."*

### For Clients Who Idealize You

*"I hear that you feel like I'm the only one who can help. That's a beautiful reflection of the trust we've built. And I want to offer another truth: there are other helpers who can support you in ways I can't. Part of healthy growth is discovering that you can connect with more than one person. This is an opportunity for that."*

### For Clients in Denial About Their Needs

*"I hear that you don't think you need [therapy/specialized treatment]. I want to share what I'm seeing from the outside: [specific observations]. I could be wrong, and you know yourself best. But I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't name this. Would you be willing to at least get an evaluation?"*

### For Clients Who Feel Like Failures

*"Needing a different kind of help isn't failure. It's actually a sign of courage—you're continuing to seek what you need, even when it requires change. The work we've done together has been real and valuable. The next chapter of your healing just needs a different guide."*
