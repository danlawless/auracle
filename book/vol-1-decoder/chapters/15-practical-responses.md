# Chapter 15: Practical Responses & Scripts

## What to Actually Say and Do

---

Theory is helpful. But when you're in the moment—heart racing, mind scrambling, old patterns activating—you need something concrete.

This chapter provides scripts, strategies, and specific responses for common situations. Not to make you perfect at handling narcissists (no one is), but to give you options when you need them most.

---

## Core Principles

Before the scripts, understand the principles behind them:

### Principle 1: You Can't Win the Argument

Narcissists aren't arguing to reach truth—they're arguing to dominate. If you "win" logically, they'll shift tactics. If you prove your point, they'll move the goalposts.

**Implication:** Stop trying to convince them. Your goal isn't to make them understand—it's to maintain your position and exit the conversation with your energy intact.

### Principle 2: Reaction Is Supply

They feed on your emotional response—positive or negative. Outrage, tears, desperate explanation—all of it confirms their importance and gives them material to use.

**Implication:** The less you react, the less they get. Flat, brief, uninteresting responses starve the dynamic.

### Principle 3: You Don't Owe Explanation

You've been trained to explain, justify, and defend. This keeps you in the conversation, keeps you accountable to their standards, keeps you trying to be understood.

**Implication:** Complete sentences. No elaboration. You don't need them to agree for your position to be valid.

### Principle 4: Exits Are Power

The ability to leave a conversation—physically or emotionally—is your greatest leverage. Narcissists count on your need to resolve, to connect, to not leave things unfinished.

**Implication:** Leave. End the call. Stop responding. Walk away. This isn't failure—it's strategy.

## The Spiritual Aikido Response

When someone attacks with control energy, don't meet force with force. Redirect.

### What It Looks Like

**Them:** "Just checking to make sure as this is not your home."

**You:** "My home is in my heart 😂🙏"

This response:
- Doesn't defend
- Doesn't explain
- Doesn't engage with the underlying control
- Transcends the entire frame

**Them:** "Huh?"

They're confused because you didn't play. Their "Huh?" is frustration that you're not feeding the dynamic.

**You:** Don't elaborate. The confusion is theirs.

### More Examples

**Them:** "You'd be lucky to be with me."

**You:** "I hope you find what you're looking for."

**Them:** "You're too sensitive."

**You:** "Maybe. Thanks for the feedback."

**Them:** "After everything I've done for you..."

**You:** "I appreciate everything. And I still need [boundary]."

**Them:** "We need to talk."

**You:** "About what specifically?"

### The Energy

Stay calm. Stay light. Stay slightly amused if you can manage it. You're not fighting—you're redirecting. You're not at their level—you're above it.

To be clear: spiritual bypassing would mean suppressing real feelings. What we're talking about is conscious choice about what frequency to respond from.

---

## Closing Conversations with Power

How you end a conversation matters. Here's how to close while holding your frame:

### The Redirect Close

"Enjoy your creations! Take care."

This:
- Acknowledges their self-focus
- Wishes them well
- Closes the conversation
- Maintains lightness and warmth
- Holds the frame to the very end

### The Boundary Close

"I'm going to stop this conversation here. We can talk when [condition]."

Use when:
- Volume is escalating
- You're being talked over
- The conversation is going in circles
- You're emotionally flooding

Then actually stop. Leave the room, hang up, stop responding.

### The Information Request Close

"What would 'resolved' actually look like for you?"

This exposes whether they want resolution or endless conflict. If they can answer, you have something to work with. If they can't, you know the game.

### The Acknowledgment Without Agreement Close

"I hear that you feel that way. I see it differently."

Not arguing. Not conceding. Simply stating that two perspectives exist. Then ending.

---

## Scripts for Specific Situations

### When They're Checking Up On You

**Them:** "Just wanted to make sure you're okay. Where are you? Who are you with?"

**Options:**

- "I'm fine. I'll reach out if I need anything."
- "Thanks for thinking of me. I'm good."
- "I appreciate the concern. I've got it handled."

**Don't do:** Explain your whereabouts, defend your choices, get into why you don't need checking on.

---

### When They Bring Up What They've Done for You

**Them:** "After everything I've done for you, after all I've sacrificed, this is how you treat me?"

**Options:**

- "I'm grateful for what you've done. And I still need [boundary]."
- "Both things can be true—I appreciate the past and I need something different now."
- "I'm not saying past kindness doesn't matter. I'm saying current treatment also matters."

**Don't do:** List everything you've done for them. Get into who's done more. Apologize for having needs.

---

### When They Say You're Too Sensitive

**Them:** "You're too sensitive. You're making a big deal out of nothing."

**Options:**

- "Maybe. This still matters to me."
- "I don't experience myself that way, but thanks for sharing."
- "I hear that you see it that way."

**Don't do:** Defend your sensitivity. Try to prove the thing is actually a big deal. Suppress your response to seem less sensitive.

---

### When They're Revising Reality

**Them:** "I never said that. You're making things up. That's not what happened."

**Options:**

- "I know what I experienced."
- "We remember it differently."
- "I trust my perception."

**Don't do:** Over-explain what really happened. Pull out receipts (unless legally necessary). Beg them to acknowledge reality.

---

### When They Play Victim

**Them:** "You're hurting me. I'm the victim here. You don't understand what I've been through."

**Options:**

- "I'm sorry you're in pain. And I still need [boundary]."
- "I understand you're hurting. That doesn't change what I need."
- "I can hold compassion for your pain and hold my position at the same time."

**Don't do:** Drop your concern to care for theirs. Apologize for the impact of your boundary. Make their feelings your responsibility.

---

### Responding to Pity Plays

When confronted about lying, cheating, or boundary violations, they pivot to self-pity rather than accountability.

**Them:** "I always ruin the good things. I don't know why I'm like this. I'm broken. I sabotage myself."

**Your response:**

"That's something you'll need to work on, but it doesn't excuse what happened."

**When they try to shift to their pain:**

**Them:** "I'm just so messed up. I don't deserve you."

**Your response:**

"I hear that you're struggling. And the behavior was still unacceptable."

**When they say "I'm broken" or "I don't know why I'm like this":**

**Your response:**

"I hope you get the support you need. This conversation is about what happened, not why."

**The key principle:** Stay on behavior, not their inner world. Do not comfort them. Do not redirect to their emotions. Hold accountability steady: "Regardless of why, the action was wrong."

**What's happening:** Their "pain" is a shield, not a wound. The pity play accomplishes three things instantly:
1. Stops accountability (you can't stay angry at a "wounded soul")
2. Reverses roles (suddenly you feel bad for them)
3. Re-opens emotional access (now you're managing their feelings)

**Your power:** Withdraw emotional labor. That is the REAL boundary.

---

### When They Escalate Volume

**Them:** *[RAISING VOICE, TALKING OVER YOU]*

**Options:**

- Lower your own voice. Say calmly: "I'm going to pause until we can both speak at normal volume."
- "I don't discuss things at this volume. Let me know when you're ready."
- Leave the room without explanation.

**Don't do:** Match their volume. Try to out-shout them. Concede just to make it stop.

---

### When They Make Threats

**General threats:**

**Them:** "If you leave, you'll never see the kids. If you tell anyone, I'll make sure you regret it. You'll be nothing without me."

**Options:**

- Don't respond in the moment. Document.
- "I'm not going to respond to threats."
- Seek professional support (lawyer, therapist, domestic violence resources).

**Don't do:** Make counter-threats. Engage with the content of the threat. Let fear make your decisions.

*Note: If threats involve physical harm, get to safety and contact authorities.*

---

**Suicide threats:**

**Them:** "If you leave, I'll kill myself. I can't live without you. I'll jump off this balcony right now."

**Your response:**

1. **Call 911 or a crisis line immediately.** Say: "I'm calling for help because you're saying you want to hurt yourself."
2. **Contact their family, friends, or emergency contacts** if you have them.
3. **Do not take responsibility for their life.** You are not a mental health professional. You cannot prevent someone else's suicide by staying in an abusive relationship.
4. **Still leave if you need to leave.** Their threat does not obligate you to stay.

**Why this is critical:**

- If they're genuinely suicidal, they need professional help you cannot provide. Calling 911 gets them that help.
- If they're manipulating you (using the threat to control), calling 911 calls their bluff and shows that tactic won't work.
- Either way, you've done what you can. Their choices after that are theirs.

**What not to do:**

- Don't stay to "keep them alive." You can't. And you'll destroy yourself trying.
- Don't negotiate ("I'll stay if you get help"). Suicide threats are abuse. There's no deal to be made.
- Don't keep it secret. Tell people. This is too big to carry alone.
- Don't become their suicide prevention plan. That's not love—that's hostage-taking.

---

### When They Hoover (Try to Pull You Back)

**Them:** After silence, suddenly: "I've been thinking about you. I miss you. Remember the good times? I've changed."

**Options:**

- Don't respond.
- If you must respond: "I wish you well. I'm not available for reconnection."
- Block if possible.

**Don't do:** Engage with the "changed" narrative without extensive evidence over time. Let nostalgia override pattern recognition. Forget why you left.

---

### When You're Tempted to Use Their Tactics Back (Mimicry Defense)

Sometimes you'll be tempted to give them a taste of their own medicine. Say "Huh?" back when they try to confuse you. Go cold when they seek warmth. Mirror their manipulation.

**Why it's tempting:**
- It feels like justice
- It might throw them off balance
- You want them to understand how it feels

**Why it usually backfires:**
- They're better at this game than you—they've been playing it longer
- It lowers you to their level and makes you feel worse about yourself
- It gives them ammunition ("See? You're just as bad as me")
- It extends the engagement rather than ending it
- It feeds the dynamic rather than starving it

**The exception:** Brief, strategic gray rock responses that deflect without engaging. Saying "Huh?" once to refuse elaboration is different from entering a "Huh?" war.

**Your actual power move:** You win by not playing. Confusion tactics work on people who try to make sense of them. If you simply don't engage—don't explain, don't mirror, don't react—there's nothing for them to work with.

The most disorienting thing you can do to a narcissist isn't to beat them at their game. It's to leave the game entirely.

## The 5-Second Response Protocol

When hit with a tactic and caught off guard:

**Second 1-2:** Pause. Take a breath. Say nothing.

**Second 3:** Internally identify: "This is [tactic name]."

**Second 4:** Choose from your response bank (see below).

**Second 5:** Deliver flatly. Do not elaborate.

### The Universal Response Bank

Memorize these. They work for almost any tactic:

- "I hear you."
- "That's one way to see it."
- "I'll think about that."
- "Interesting perspective."
- "We see it differently."
- "This isn't productive."
- "I'm not going to engage with that."
- "Not my world." (Disengages from their drama/reality without argument)
- *Silence + unchanged expression*

### The Broken Record Technique

When they push back on your boundary:

1. State your position once, clearly
2. When they argue, repeat it identically
3. Don't add new information or justification
4. Match their escalation with calm repetition

**Example:**
- You: "I'm not discussing this tonight."
- Them: "But we need to resolve this!"
- You: "I'm not discussing this tonight."
- Them: "You always run away from problems!"
- You: "I'm not discussing this tonight."
- Them: [Escalates]
- You: "I'm not discussing this tonight." [Exit room if needed]

The repetition signals: This isn't a negotiation. The answer won't change.

## When You Must Coexist

Sometimes you can't escape—co-parenting, work, family events, shared communities. Here's how to protect yourself:

### The Neutral Presence Protocol

At events where they'll be present:

**Before:**
- Set your intention (e.g., "I will stay grounded regardless of what happens")
- Visualize a boundary or shield of golden white or luminescent energy around you
- Plan your gray rock responses for likely provocations
- Identify your escape route if needed

**During:**
- Greet briefly, then don't orbit their space
- Keep interactions short and factual
- Don't be drawn into private conversations
- Stay connected to allies
- Have an activity (helping in kitchen, watching kids)

**After:**
- Leave without guilt
- Practice energetic clearing (shake it off, shower, nature)
- Process with safe person if needed
- Celebrate your navigation

### The Somatic Cue

Develop a physical cue that reminds your body to regulate:

- Press thumb and forefinger together
- Feet firmly on floor
- Hand on heart
- Three deep breaths

Practice this when calm so it becomes automatic when activated.

### The Social Cue That Deters

Body language that says "not available" without words:

- Relaxed but closed posture (not inviting)
- Minimal eye contact
- Orientation toward other people/activities
- Engaged in conversation with others
- Friendly but brief if they approach

You don't have to be rude. You just don't have to be available.

## Holding Boundaries with Family

Family relationships carry unique guilt and obligation scripts. Here's how to hold boundaries without explaining your way out of them.

### When mother asks why you're distant:

**Her:** "You seem so distant lately. Did I do something wrong?"

**Your response:**

"I'm taking space to focus on what feels healthy for me right now."

**Don't:** Explain further. Explanations become ammunition. Let the statement stand.

---

### When mother leaks your confidence to sibling:

**Internal reframe:** "This is information about her capacity, not my worth."

**External action:** Lower the amount you share going forward. No announcement needed. Simply adjust your vulnerability level based on demonstrated trustworthiness.

---

### When family guilts you about grandchildren/events:

**Them:** "We hardly see you anymore. The kids miss you. Family is supposed to be together."

**Your responses:**

- "I'll let you know what works for me."
- "That doesn't work for me, but I hope you have a wonderful time."

**Don't:** Justify your availability. Defend your choices. Apologize for having boundaries.

---

### When family says "After everything I've done for you..."

**Your responses:**

- "I'm grateful for what you've given. And I still get to have boundaries."
- "I understand you feel that way."

**Don't:** Get into ledgers. List what you've done in return. Collapse into guilt.

**The principle:** Family membership does not equal unlimited access. Past help does not equal future obligation to accept harmful behavior.

## Scripts for Declining Symbolic Contact

After setting boundaries or ending relationships, they may send minimal, symbolic contact that keeps the door slightly open without offering real connection.

### When they send minimal contact ("Happy Birthday."):

**Option 1:** No response (this is valid and complete)

**Option 2** (if you must respond): "Thank you." [Nothing more]

**Don't:** Re-engage. Ask how they are. Open conversation. Interpret this as a sign they've changed.

---

### When you want to communicate you'd prefer no contact:

**Your message:**

"I appreciate the thought, but I'm not in a place where minimal contact feels meaningful. I'd prefer we either engage genuinely or give each other space."

**Why this works:** It names the pattern (minimal contact) and offers a clear choice (genuine or none). It doesn't blame, just clarifies your need.

---

### When someone asks if they can "check on you":

**Them:** "Can I check on you? I just want to make sure you're okay."

**Your response:**

"I'm good—I'll reach out if I need anything."

**Don't:** Provide details. Justify your independence. Agree to check-ins that undermine your boundaries.

*See also: Chapter 3, Tactics 35 & 37; Chapter 8, Card 24 for pattern recognition*

---

### When you need to exit a conversation that's activating you:

**Your response:**

"I need to step away for a moment."

**That's it.** No explanation. No negotiation. Just exit.

**Practice this:** Your needs don't require justification. "I need to step away" is a complete sentence.

---

## When Speaking to Authority Figures About Them

If you need to explain the situation to a therapist, lawyer, HR, or other professional:

### What Works

- Describe behavior, not labels: "He monitors my location and questions my activities" rather than "He's a narcissist"
- Give specific examples with dates if possible
- Focus on impact: "I feel afraid/exhausted/confused"
- Bring documentation if you have it
- Be factual, not dramatic

### What Doesn't Work

- Diagnosing them: "He has NPD"
- Being so emotional that your credibility suffers
- Badmouthing without specific examples
- Expecting the authority to immediately understand

---

## When You Want to Send That Message

You've drafted the perfect message explaining everything. You want to send it. You imagine them finally understanding.

### Before You Send, Ask:

1. **What do I hope to accomplish?**
2. **Has explanation ever worked before?**
3. **Will this give them information they'll use against me?**
4. **Am I hoping to change them or prove something to myself?**
5. **Will I feel better or worse after their response (or non-response)?**

### The Unsent Letter Practice

Write everything you want to say. Pour it all out. Then:

- Read it to yourself
- Read it to a safe person
- Burn it, bury it, or delete it
- Let the expression happen without the sending

Often the need is to express, not to be received by them. You can meet that need without actually engaging.

---

## Chapter Summary

**Core Principles:**
1. You can't win the argument—stop trying
2. Reaction is supply—starve the dynamic
3. You don't owe explanation—brief is better
4. Exits are power—leaving is strategy

**Key Strategies:**
- Spiritual aikido: redirect, don't combat
- Close conversations on your terms
- Gray rock when you must interact
- Somatic and social cues for protection
- Describe behavior to authorities, not labels

**Remember:**
These scripts aren't magic. They won't transform the narcissist. They won't guarantee good outcomes. What they do is give you options—ways to respond that don't drain you, don't feed them, and don't abandon yourself.

---

## Advanced Tactics

### The Strategic Silence

Silence is your most underused tool:

- After they make a provocative statement: Wait 5 seconds before responding. Or don't respond at all.
- During arguments: Stop engaging. Silence often exposes their need for your reaction.
- After setting a boundary: State it and go silent. No justification. No repetition unless pushed.

Silence forces them to sit with their own words. It's uncomfortable for people who need constant supply.

### The Question Redirect

Instead of defending, ask:

- "What would you like me to do with that information?"
- "What outcome are you hoping for?"
- "Help me understand what you need right now."
- "Is there something specific you'd like me to change?"

This shifts the labor to them. They must articulate what they want—which often exposes that they want control, not resolution.

### The Exit Ladder

When a conversation is escalating, use progressive exits:

**Level 1 - Topic Exit:** "I'm not discussing that. What else is on your mind?"

**Level 2 - Conversation Exit:** "I'm going to stop this conversation for now."

**Level 3 - Room Exit:** "I'm stepping away." [Leave]

**Level 4 - Contact Exit:** "I'm ending this call/visit." [Leave/hang up]

You don't have to announce which level you're moving to. Just execute.

### The Documentation Discipline

After every significant interaction, record:
- Date and time
- What was said (as close to verbatim as possible)
- What tactic was used
- How you responded
- How you felt

This builds:
1. Your reality anchor when they gaslight
2. Evidence if needed legally
3. Pattern clarity over time
4. A reminder of why you're protecting yourself

### The Pre-Interaction Checklist

Before any planned interaction with a narcissist:

- [ ] What's my intention? (Information only? Brief social? Boundary enforcement?)
- [ ] What tactics do I expect?
- [ ] What are my scripted responses?
- [ ] What's my exit trigger? (What behavior means I leave?)
- [ ] What's my exit line?
- [ ] Who can I debrief with after?

Preparation is protection. Going in blind is asking to be destabilized.
