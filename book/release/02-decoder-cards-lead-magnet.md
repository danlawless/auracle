**A Free Quick-Reference Guide from *You Are Not Crazy: The Narcissism Decoder***

---

*Use these cards to recognize manipulation in real-time. Each card names a pattern, reveals what's really happening, and gives you a power move to respond.*

---

## How to Use These Cards

- **In the moment:** When something confusing happens, ask "Which pattern is this?"
- **For processing:** After difficult interactions, review relevant cards
- **For prevention:** Familiarize yourself with patterns before they appear
- **For teaching:** Share with friends who are struggling

---

## Card 1: Concern as Control

**The Pattern:** "Just checking on you"

**What They Say:**
- "Just wanted to make sure you're okay"
- "I was worried about you"
- "Where are you? Who are you with?"

**What's Really Happening:**
Surveillance disguised as concern. This positions them as protector while you become the one who needs monitoring.

**Your Power Move:**
"I'm fine—I'll reach out if I need anything." Don't explain or provide details. Caring people trust your ability to manage yourself.

---

## Card 2: The Gaslight Loop

**The Pattern:** Repeated "Huh?" and confusion responses

**What They Say:**
- "That doesn't make sense"
- "I don't understand what you're saying"
- "You're not being clear"

**What's Really Happening:**
Your way of expressing yourself is being framed as nonsensical. The confusion is manufactured to make you doubt yourself.

**Your Power Move:**
Don't elaborate. "I was clear. Let me know when you're ready to engage with what I said."

---

## Card 3: The Shame Dump

**The Pattern:** "I feel bad for you"

**What They Say:**
- "You're too sensitive"
- "That's a you problem"
- "I worry about how you come across"

**What's Really Happening:**
Their shame is being deposited in you. You become the container for feelings they refuse to own.

**Your Power Move:**
Internal: "I return this shame to its source."
External: "I don't experience myself that way, but thanks for sharing."

---

## Card 4: Withholding as Punishment

**The Pattern:** Silence and coldness after conflict

**What They Do:**
- One-word answers
- The silent treatment
- "I'm fine" (clearly not fine)

**What's Really Happening:**
Normal warmth is withdrawn as punishment. You're supposed to feel the cold and abandon your position to restore connection.

**Your Power Move:**
Don't chase. "I notice you're withdrawn. I'm here when you're ready to talk directly."

---

## Card 5: The Moving Target

**The Pattern:** Nothing is ever enough

**What They Say:**
- "Well, you did that, but you didn't..."
- "That's not what I meant"
- "Now this is the real issue..."

**What's Really Happening:**
You're chasing a target that moves every time you approach. Your perpetual inadequacy is the point.

**Your Power Move:**
"I notice every time I address one thing, another appears. What would 'enough' actually look like?"

---

## Card 6: Righteous Cruelty

**The Pattern:** "I'm just being honest"

**What They Say:**
- "Someone needs to tell you the truth"
- "I'm only saying this because I care"
- "You can't handle the truth"

**What's Really Happening:**
Cruelty dressed as virtue. The "truth" serves their need to diminish you, not your need to grow.

**Your Power Move:**
Real feedback is given with care, at appropriate times, for your benefit. If it feels like an attack, it is.

---

## Card 7: The Comparison Trap

**The Pattern:** References to others you should be more like

**What They Say:**
- "My ex never had this problem"
- "Most people would be grateful"
- "I could find someone who..."

**What's Really Happening:**
You're being reminded that you're replaceable, measured against phantoms who are somehow better.

**Your Power Move:**
"I'm not in competition for this relationship. If you'd prefer to be with someone else, that's a choice you can make."

---

## Card 8: Pity as Permission

**The Pattern:** Using their wounds to excuse behavior

**What They Say:**
- "You don't understand what I've been through"
- "I'm just damaged"
- "Everyone leaves me"

**What's Really Happening:**
Past pain becomes a reason not to address current harm. Attention redirects from what they're doing to what was done to them.

**Your Power Move:**
Pain explains; it doesn't excuse. "I'm sorry you went through that. And I still need this behavior to change."

---

## Card 9: The Guilt Ledger

**The Pattern:** Reminders of past kindness

**What They Say:**
- "After everything I've done for you..."
- "You owe me"
- "How could you do this after all I've sacrificed?"

**What's Really Happening:**
Previous kindnesses are being converted into debt. Generosity wasn't free—it was investment.

**Your Power Move:**
"I'm grateful for what you've done. That doesn't mean I accept how you're treating me now."

---

## Card 10: Weaponized Vulnerability

**The Pattern:** Emotional flooding to avoid accountability

**What They Do:**
- Breaking down crying when confronted
- "You're making me feel terrible"
- "I might hurt myself if you leave"

**What's Really Happening:**
Their emotional reaction becomes more important than the issue. Your concern gets buried under managing their feelings.

**Your Power Move:**
"I can see you're upset. This conversation is still important. Let me know when you're ready to continue."

---

## Card 11: Reality Revision

**The Pattern:** Changing what was said or agreed

**What They Say:**
- "I never said that"
- "You're misremembering"
- "You're making things up"

**What's Really Happening:**
History is being rewritten. If they control the narrative, they control reality.

**Your Power Move:**
Trust your perception. "I know what I experienced." You don't need their agreement for your experience to be valid.

---

## Card 12: The Future Promise

**The Pattern:** Dangling tomorrow to control today

**What They Say:**
- "Things will be different after [event]"
- "I'm working on myself"
- "Just wait—you'll see the real me"

**What's Really Happening:**
Hope is weaponized. By keeping you invested in a future that never arrives, they maintain control now.

**Your Power Move:**
"I'm making decisions based on who you are now, not who you promise to be." Potential doesn't pay bills. Consistency does.

---

## The 3-3-3 Rule

When you recognize a pattern, use this before responding:

**3 Seconds:** Pause. Count silently. Interrupt the automatic reaction.

**3 Breaths:** Inhale 4, exhale 6. Engage your calm nervous system.

**3 Words (or fewer):** "I'll think about that." "Interesting perspective." "Not for me."

*The less you say, the less they have to twist.*

---

## The Emergency Protocol

When activated and confused:

1. **Name it:** Which card matches what just happened?
2. **Breathe:** Three deep breaths, exhaling slowly
3. **Remember:** "This is a pattern. It's not about me."
4. **Choose:** What's the power move?
5. **Document:** Write it down later for your reality anchor
