### Script

Welcome to The Narcissism Decoder course.

If you're here, something felt off.

Maybe it was a relationship that left you questioning your own sanity. Maybe it was a family dynamic that always seemed to drain you, no matter how much you gave. Maybe it was a friendship that felt more like a hostage situation than a connection.

Or maybe you're just starting to wake up to patterns you've lived with your entire life—patterns you thought were normal until you realized they weren't.

I know this path. I walked it for decades before I could see it clearly.

I grew up in a household where these patterns were the air I breathed. By the time I was old enough to choose my own relationships, I chose exactly what I knew—a dysregulated husband who confirmed everything I'd learned about love. When I finally broke free, I thought I was done. Instead, I found myself choosing the same patterns in different faces, over and over, until I finally understood: the pattern wasn't just in them. It was in me. Breaking it required learning to see what I'd been trained not to see.

That's what this course teaches. What I wish someone had given me twenty years ago.

This is your decoder ring.

Over the next ten hours, you're going to learn to recognize manipulation patterns in real-time. Not days later, lying awake at night thinking, "Wait, did that really just happen?" But in the moment, as it's happening, with enough clarity to respond from power rather than reaction.

Here's what I want you to know before we begin.

Three things you need to hear:

**You are not crazy.**

If you've been told you're too sensitive, too dramatic, too needy—if you've been made to feel like your reactions are the problem while obvious harm is dismissed—this course will show you what was really happening.

Let that land.

**You are not weak.**

Getting hooked by these patterns is not a character flaw. It's biology. Your nervous system was doing exactly what it was designed to do. We'll explore why in Module 3.

Let that land.

**You are not alone.**

Many people have experienced what you've experienced. The confusion, the self-doubt, the exhausting cycle of hope and disappointment. This is a shared experience with shared patterns—patterns we can learn to recognize and decode.

Let that land.

**Here's how this course works.**

We have six modules ahead of us.

Module 1, where we are now, is about Recognition. You'll learn to recognize control in your body before your mind catches up. You'll understand the invisible architecture that makes manipulation work.

Module 2 is The Playbook. We'll decode the specific manipulation tactics, organized by function. By the end, you'll be able to name what was done to you.

Module 3 is The Systems. We'll see how manipulation operates across family systems, romantic relationships, friendships, and work environments. You'll understand trauma bonds and why leaving feels so impossibly hard.

Module 4 is The Decoder Cards. You'll master 52 quick-reference patterns for real-time recognition. These are practical tools you can use in the moment.

Module 5 is Response and Recovery. You'll learn what to actually say. You'll rewire your nervous system. You'll take your first steps toward integration.

Module 6 is Advanced Recognition. You've come so far. Now we go deeper into subtle patterns and complex dynamics that only become visible once you've mastered the foundations.

**A few things before we go further.**

This material may activate you. That means you might feel strong emotions as we go. Memories might surface. You might feel anger, grief, or a strange kind of relief.

All of that is normal. All of that is part of the process.

Your nervous system stored these experiences for a reason. It was trying to protect you. Now, you're choosing to look directly at what happened. That takes courage.

Go at your own pace. Pause when you need to. Come back when you're ready. This is not a race.

You have permission to feel whatever you feel.

You have permission to believe your own experience.

You have permission to protect yourself.

That's what we're learning here—not just to see clearly, but to trust that seeing clearly is enough. That you don't need anyone else to validate what your body already knows.

**Your first tool.**

Before our next lesson, I want you to start noticing something.

Pay attention to your body after interactions. Not during—after.

How do you feel after talking to certain people? Lighter or heavier? More yourself or less? Energized or drained?

Don't analyze it yet. Just notice. Your body is already giving you information. We're going to learn to trust that information.

That's your only homework before we continue: start noticing how you feel after.

**In our next lesson,** we'll explore the invisible architecture of control—how manipulation works at a level most people never see. Once you understand the structure, you'll never be fooled by it again.

Take a breath.

You've already begun.

## Exercise

**Body Awareness Practice**

For the next 48 hours, after every significant interaction:

1. Pause for 10 seconds
2. Scan your body: chest, stomach, shoulders, throat
3. Notice: Do you feel lighter or heavier? Expanded or contracted?
4. Write one word in your journal describing how you feel

Don't analyze or explain. Just notice and record.

## Key Concepts

- Manipulation patterns can be learned and recognized
- Your nervous system already has valuable information
- Confusion is often manufactured by the manipulator
- Recognition is the first step toward freedom
