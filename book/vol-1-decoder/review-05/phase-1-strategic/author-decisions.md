---

## Diana (Developmental Editor) Questions

### Section A: Format Expansion Opportunities

**Q1. Audio Edition Approach**
- **Decision:** A - Create audio edition with narrator plus author commentary
- **Rationale:** Provides premium value and author perspective

**Q2. Workbook Companion**
- **Decision:** A + D - Create comprehensive workbook AND keep embedded exercises
- **Rationale:** Standalone workbook expands format options while maintaining integrated learning in the book

**Q3. Decoder Cards Format**
- **Decision:** A - Multi-format optimization (print, mobile, physical)
- **Rationale:** Maximum accessibility across use contexts

**Q4. Quick Reference Tools**
- **Decision:** C - Create parallel quick reference products
- **Rationale:** Separate products allow focused tools without disrupting book flow

### Section B: Content Expansion Opportunities

**Q5. Decoder Card Expansion**
- **Decision:** A - Expand toward 50 cards
- **Author Note:** Review indicates 52 cards already exist in consolidated playbook (Chapter 3). Task required: Review all 52 cards for applicability, truth, and commonality. Check for missing cards related to dysregulation and narcissism tactics.

**Q6. Context Expansion**
- **Decision:** E - Expand all contexts (workplace, family, friendships, digital)
- **Rationale:** Comprehensive coverage serves broader audience

**Q7. Recovery Content**
- **Decision:** C - Practical focus (no-contact strategies, gray rock techniques)
- **Rationale:** Actionable content bridges recognition to healing

**Q8. Gender Balance**
- **Decision:** A - Integrated approach throughout
- **Author Note:** Include specific male example: "Baby trap" scenario where woman gets pregnant to keep man for resources or to "own" the man. Example includes:
  - Case 1: Loving man who stayed despite manipulation
  - Case 2: Man operating under illusion of "divine union" (spiritual bypass), catching up to peers (over 40, never had relationship longer than 6 months due to inability to take accountability). Pattern of choosing women with limited English proficiency as manipulation via language barrier.

### Section C: Structural Refinement

**Q9. Philosophical Framework**
- **Decision:** A + B for current volume, D for future volumes
- **Rationale:** Current volume uses Western psychology + attachment theory. Eastern philosophy integrates progressively across series as volumes advance.

**Q10. Course Structure**
- **Decision:** C - Add Module 6 (Advanced Recognition)
- **Rationale:** Expands depth without disrupting existing structure

**Q11. Chapter Length Optimization**
- **Decision:** D - Create 15-minute highlight versions
- **Rationale:** Alternative format for quick consumption without altering main chapters

**Q12. Cross-References**
- **Decision:** A + C - Enhance within-book links AND add course integration
- **Author Note:** Course materials already started - these need reviewing for current state of the book due to substantial changes made during Rounds 1-4.

### Section D: Future Development

**Q13. Assessment Tools**
- **Decision:** D - Self-directed assessments
- **Rationale:** Reader autonomy in self-assessment process

**Q14. Series Preview**
- **Decision:** B - Current preview sufficient
- **Rationale:** Existing series preview adequately sets expectations

**Q15. Edition Strategy**
- **Decision:** A - Edition model (2nd edition with enhancements)
- **Rationale:** Clear versioning for readers and market positioning
