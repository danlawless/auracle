## Finding Professional Help

### Types of Professionals Who Can Help

**Therapists/Counselors:**
- Look for those specializing in trauma, PTSD, narcissistic abuse, or complex trauma
- Modalities that may help: EMDR, somatic therapy, IFS (Internal Family Systems), DBT, trauma-focused CBT

**Psychiatrists:**
- Can evaluate for conditions that may co-occur (depression, anxiety, PTSD)
- Can prescribe medication if appropriate

**Coaches:**
- Narcissistic abuse recovery coaches (not a replacement for therapy, but can supplement)
- Life coaches specializing in relationship recovery

### Questions to Ask Potential Therapists

1. "What is your experience working with survivors of narcissistic abuse or emotional abuse?"
2. "Are you familiar with concepts like gaslighting, trauma bonding, and coercive control?"
3. "What therapeutic approaches do you use for trauma?"
4. "How do you feel about clients who need to set firm boundaries with family members?"
5. "What is your approach if a client is considering going no-contact with a family member?"

**Red flags in therapists:**
- Pushing for reconciliation without understanding the dynamics
- Minimizing your experience
- Suggesting you need to "forgive and forget"
- Lack of familiarity with narcissistic abuse patterns
- Making you feel judged for your choices

## Safety Planning

### A Personal Note

Before I share this checklist, I want you to know: I did this too.

For months before I left, I quietly sent things I wanted to keep to my parents' home. I had a plan with my therapist—we talked through exactly when and how I would leave. My mom had told me: *when you try to leave, they could try to kill you.*

That didn't happen. But I was cautious anyway.

If you are secretly preparing—sending things to safe places, making quiet plans, having conversations no one knows about—you are not being paranoid. You are being wise. The fact that leaving might go smoothly doesn't mean your preparation was unnecessary. You are honoring what *could* happen, and that is self-protection.

Your caution is not overreaction. It's intelligence.

---

### Creating a Safety Plan

If you are still in contact with an abusive person, create a safety plan:

1. **Identify safe people** — Who can you call in crisis? Give them context in advance.

2. **Prepare an emergency bag** — Include:
   - Important documents (ID, passport, birth certificates)
   - Medications
   - Cash
   - Phone charger
   - Change of clothes
   - Keys

3. **Know your exits** — At home, at work, in common locations

4. **Document everything** — Save evidence in a place they can't access

5. **Code words** — Establish with trusted people for when you need help

6. **Financial preparation** — Open a separate bank account if possible, know your financial situation

7. **Technology safety:**
   - Check for tracking apps on your phone
   - Use private/incognito browsing
   - Create new email accounts they don't know about
   - Be aware of location sharing settings

Your nervous system can heal through free practices: grounding exercises, journaling, movement, nature, safe connection with others, and simply giving yourself permission to feel what you feel.

## Your First 90 Days: Post-Exit Protocols

### The 90-Day Forward Protocol

A practical roadmap for the first three months post-recognition/exit:

**Days 1-30: Stabilize**
- Establish no contact or minimal contact protocols
- Identify and connect with your safe person
- Begin documentation practice
- One grounding technique daily
- Don't make major life decisions

**Days 31-60: Understand**
- Work through this book systematically
- Identify which tactics were used on you
- Understand your specific vulnerabilities
- Begin therapy if you haven't already
- Start identifying triggers

**Days 61-90: Rebuild**
- Reconnect with abandoned interests/relationships
- Establish daily wellness practices
- Create your support architecture
- Begin setting boundaries in other areas of life
- Start thinking about what you want next

**After 90 Days:**
- Review progress
- Adjust protocols as needed
- Consider longer-term changes (career, location, relationships)
- Continue healing work at your pace

### The Red-Yellow-Green System

For daily check-ins:

**Green:** I feel stable. Practicing my protocols. Not activated.
- Keep doing what you're doing

**Yellow:** I feel triggered or tempted. Old patterns surfacing. Considering contact.
- Deploy emergency protocols
- Contact safe person
- Extra grounding today
- Don't act on impulses

**Red:** Crisis. Overwhelming activation. Relapse or near-relapse.
- Reach out immediately (safe person, therapist, hotline)
- Remove means of contact if possible
- Intense self-care
- No shame—reset and begin again

Check in with yourself daily. Know your color.

---

*Every time you name the pattern instead of reliving it, your nervous system learns a new route home.*

## For Helpers and Supporters

- Offer concrete help ("I can help you find a therapist" vs. "You should get help")
- Educate yourself on the dynamics
- Respect their timeline
- Keep the door open even if they return to the relationship

**Don't:**
- Criticize or badmouth their partner (they may defend them)
- Give ultimatums
- Expect them to leave on your timeline
- Take over or make decisions for them
- Share information without their permission

**Resources for Supporters:**
- *Helping Her Get Free* by Susan Brewster — Guide for friends and family
- National Domestic Violence Hotline has resources for friends and family

## Moving Forward

### Signs of Healing

Recovery isn't linear, but here are signs you're making progress:
- You trust your own perception more often
- You can identify manipulation tactics in real-time
- Your nervous system feels calmer
- You're setting boundaries with less guilt
- You can think about the past without being consumed by it
- You're forming healthier relationships
- You feel like yourself again

### Building a New Life

As you heal, consider:
- **New relationships:** Moving slowly, watching for patterns, trusting your body's signals
- **Career:** Many survivors discover new passions and strengths after leaving
- **Purpose:** Your experience can become wisdom that helps others (when you're ready)
- **Joy:** Rediscovering what you love, what brings you peace, what makes you *you*
