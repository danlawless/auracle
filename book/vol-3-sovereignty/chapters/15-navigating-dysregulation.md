# Chapter 15: Navigating Others' Dysregulation

## When They Haven't Done the Work

---

You've done the work.

You've named your patterns. You've trained your nervous system. You've built internal authority.

And now you're in rooms, relationships, and families with people who haven't.

This is where sovereignty gets practical.

**How do you stay regulated in the presence of dysregulation—without absorbing, fixing, or abandoning?**

## Field Note (Before): The Emotional Firefighter

His friend is spiraling.

Before he can think, he's in problem-solving mode. Offering advice. Managing the crisis. Staying calm so they don't have to.

Hours later, he's exhausted—and he hasn't said a word about his own day.

He can't figure out why he keeps losing himself.

---

## Field Note (After): The Witness

His friend is spiraling.

He listens. He nods. He doesn't interrupt with solutions.

When there's a pause, he says: "That sounds really hard."

His friend keeps talking. Eventually, they settle.

He didn't fix anything. He didn't absorb anything.

He witnessed—and that was enough.

## Why Dysregulated People Are Activating

Dysregulation is contagious.

When someone near you is:
- Anxious
- Angry
- Overwhelmed
- Collapsing
- Escalating

your nervous system picks up the signal. **Mirror neurons** fire. The **amygdala** scans for threat. Stress hormones prepare you to respond.

This is automatic—it's not a choice.

For those trained in enmeshed or volatile environments, this contagion is stronger:
- You feel responsible for their state
- You feel urgent to fix it
- You feel guilty if you don't engage
- Your body reacts as if their emergency is your emergency

**Sovereignty is the practice of noticing this contagion and choosing not to join it.**

## Neuroscience Lens: Regulation as Influence

Here's what research shows:

**The most regulated nervous system in the room often sets the tone.**

When you stay grounded while others are activated:
- Your calm becomes a reference point
- Others' nervous systems have something to regulate toward
- Urgency decreases
- Clarity increases

**Key insight:** You influence others more by staying regulated than by fixing their problems.

**Translation:** Your steadiness is the most valuable thing you can offer a dysregulated person.

## What NOT to Do

### Don't Absorb
Taking on their emotional state as your own doesn't help them—and it depletes you.

### Don't Fix
Offering solutions when someone is flooded often escalates, not calms.

### Don't Match
Escalating to match their energy validates the dysregulation.

### Don't Disappear
Complete withdrawal can feel like abandonment and increase their activation.

### Don't Take It Personally
Their dysregulation is about their nervous system, not about you.

---

## What TO Do

### Stay in Your Body
Ground. Breathe. Feel your feet. Return to yourself as often as needed.

### Witness Without Absorbing
"I see you're struggling. That sounds hard."
You acknowledge without taking on.

### Offer Presence, Not Solutions
Often people need to be heard before they can hear solutions.

### Set Limits If Needed
"I can be here for about 15 more minutes."
"I'm not able to talk about this right now."

### Model Regulation
Your calm is more powerful than your words.

## The Empathy Trap

Highly empathic people often believe:

**"If I feel their pain, I'm showing that I care."**

But empathy without boundaries is absorption. And absorption doesn't help—it just creates two dysregulated people.

**True compassion maintains distinction:**

"I can see your suffering without becoming it. I can care about your pain without carrying it."

---

## Phrases for Navigating Dysregulation

**To acknowledge without fixing:**
- "That sounds really difficult."
- "I hear you."
- "That makes sense that you'd feel that way."

**To set limits:**
- "I'm not able to be helpful right now."
- "I can listen for a few minutes, but I'm not able to problem-solve."
- "I care about you, and I need to step away."

**To redirect:**
- "What do you need right now?"
- "Would it help to take a breath together?"
- "Is there something specific you need from me?"

**To exit gracefully:**
- "I need to go. I'll check in later."
- "I can see you're struggling. I don't have capacity right now."
- "I love you. I can't do this conversation right now."

## When Dysregulation Becomes Pattern

Some people are chronically dysregulated. They:
- Escalate frequently
- Need others to regulate them
- Don't take responsibility for their state
- Use crisis to connect

If someone in your life fits this pattern, you have choices:

**Limit exposure:** Reduce time, frequency, or depth of interaction.

**Set clear boundaries:** "I'm not able to be your emotional support for this."

**Don't reward escalation:** Don't give more attention when they escalate.

**Accept reality:** They may not change. Your role is to manage your exposure, not their growth.

## A Practice: The Regulation First Protocol

Use this when someone around you is dysregulated:

**Step 1:** Notice your own activation.
Where is it in your body? Name it: *"I'm getting activated."*

**Step 2:** Ground before engaging.
Three breaths. Feet on floor. Return to yourself.

**Step 3:** Ask yourself:
- "Is this my emergency?"
- "What's mine to do here?"
- "Can I help without absorbing?"

**Step 4:** Engage from regulation.
Speak slowly. Offer presence. Set limits as needed.

**Step 5:** Discharge afterward.
Walk. Breathe. Shake off what isn't yours.

## The Grief of Being Surrounded

Sometimes sovereignty means grieving that the people around you can't meet you where you are.

You've done the work. They haven't.

This can feel:
- Lonely
- Frustrating
- Sad
- Isolating

That grief is valid. And it doesn't mean you should return to old patterns.

You can grieve the gap AND stay sovereign.

---

## Reader Reflection

- Who in my life is frequently dysregulated?
- How does their state affect mine?
- What would it look like to witness without absorbing?
- What limits might I need to set?

**Body cue to notice:** Urgency to fix, tightness in chest, automatic caretaking

**Practice:** Regulate yourself first, then engage

---

## Integration Line

> *"I can care about you without carrying you. I can witness without absorbing."*

---

## Closing Note for This Chapter

You will encounter dysregulated people for the rest of your life.

Sovereignty isn't avoiding them—it's staying yourself while being near them.

Your regulation is not a wall. It's a gift.

It gives others something to organize around.

And it keeps you intact.
