## Overview

Hi! I'm Petra, the Proofreader. This is Phase 4 (Final Pass) of Review Round 4 for Volume 1: The Narcissism Decoder.

**Why Phase 4 is LAST:** Proofreading must be the final editorial step. Any content changes after proofreading could introduce new errors. I catch what everyone else missed.
