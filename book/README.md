## The Books

### [Volume 1: The Narcissism Decoder](./vol-1-decoder/README.md)
**Control Disguised as Care**

*A Guide to Recognizing, Understanding, and Breaking Free from Manipulation Patterns*

**Focus:** Recognition, naming patterns, understanding manipulation tactics

This book helps you:
- Recognize the 34 tactics of control disguised as care
- Understand why these patterns hook your nervous system
- Decode manipulation in real-time instead of days later
- Respond from a place of power rather than reaction
- Recover your sense of self and trust in your own perception

**Best for:** Those currently in confusing relationships, those beginning to wake up to patterns, anyone who needs to name what's happening.

### [Volume 2: The Bridge](./vol-2-bridge/README.md)
**Learning Secure Attachment After Trauma**

*A Guide for Emotionally Sensitive Adults Moving from Survival to Sovereign Connection*

**Focus:** Nervous system healing, attachment repair, reparenting, sovereign relationships

This book helps you:
- Understand why insight alone doesn't heal
- Retrain your nervous system for safety
- Break trauma-bonded relationship patterns
- Build secure attachment from the inside out
- Choose relationships that regulate rather than activate

**Best for:** Those who already understand the patterns but feel stuck, those healing after leaving, anyone building new relationships after trauma.

## Reading Path

### If you're currently confused or in crisis
Start with **Volume 1**. You need to name what's happening before you can heal from it.

### If you understand the patterns but can't seem to break free
Start with **Volume 2**. The issue isn't recognition—it's nervous system repatterning.

### If you're building new relationships after leaving
**Volume 2** focuses specifically on dating after trauma, partner compatibility, and secure attachment.

### If you want the complete journey
Read both, in order. Volume 1 gives you the language. Volume 2 gives you the practice.

## Core Philosophy

Both books share these principles:

1. **You were never the problem.** The patterns you adapted to survive are not character flaws.

2. **Naming creates power.** When you can name what's happening, it stops happening to you and starts happening in front of you.

3. **The body keeps the score.** Healing requires nervous system work, not just insight.

4. **Secure attachment is learned.** It's a skill you can develop, not something you either have or don't.

5. **Compassion without self-abandonment.** You can hold compassion for others while still protecting yourself.
