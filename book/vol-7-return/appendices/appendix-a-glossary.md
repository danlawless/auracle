## Key Terms for Prosperity After Trauma

---

## A

**Abundance Mindset**
Believing there is enough—not as denial, but as regulated response to scarcity programming.

**Access Drift (Professional)**
The gradual erosion of professional boundaries through incremental crossings. Personal numbers become 24/7 availability. Temporary help becomes permanent expectation. Flexibility flows only one direction.

---

## C

**Chronic Boundary Erosion**
When agreements are treated as suggestions rather than commitments. Words create safety that can't be sustained. Small broken promises accumulate into relational or professional collapse.

**Clean Money**
Financial resources received without manipulation, obligation, or compromise of integrity.

---

## F

**Financial Abuse**
Using money to control, manipulate, or create dependency. Includes withholding funds, sabotaging employment, and creating debt.

**Financial Boundaries**
Clear limits around earning, spending, lending, and discussing money.

---

## P

**Prosperity**
Financial well-being that emerges from sovereignty, not from urgency or survival need.

**Professional Boundary Scripts**
Pre-prepared language for addressing scope creep, broken promises, and access drift in professional contexts. Allows boundary-setting without reactivity.

---

## S

**Scarcity Programming**
Nervous system patterns learned in environments of lack. Creates urgency, hoarding, or avoidance around money.

**Sovereignty in Work**
Professional identity that emerges from internal authority rather than external validation or survival need.

---

## T

**Trauma Response (Financial)**
Fight, flight, freeze, or fawn patterns activated by money situations. Can include panic spending, financial avoidance, or people-pleasing in negotiations.
