## From Feardom to Freedom

Jennifer Brooke's path to helping others began with her own experience of narcissistic abuse—and the hard-won journey out of it.

A creative at heart, Jennifer has worn many hats: artist, event producer, singer, personal trainer, yoga instructor, psychotherapist, and sales professional. She holds a **Master of Science in Mental Health Counseling** and spent years working in traditional talk therapy. But none of her credentials prepared her for what she really needed to learn: how to recognize when love is actually control in disguise.

For years, she allowed herself to shrink in abusive and narcissistic relationships. Depression and anxiety became constant companions. Her self-esteem, in her own words, was "mortally wounded." Like many survivors, she had learned to seek external validation instead of trusting herself—a pattern that made her vulnerable to those who would exploit her empathy.

The breakthrough came through deep Jungian shadow work. Through transformative experiences called "Transitions," Jennifer confronted the parts of herself that had enabled toxic dynamics to continue. She released passive-aggressive patterns, negativity, blame, and the desperate need for external approval. The work was uncomfortable. It required brutal honesty about her own part in staying. But on the other side was something she'd been looking for: herself.

Through that ownership, she reclaimed her sovereignty.

## The Awakening

Jennifer's spiritual journey began in earnest with a powerful Kundalini awakening, guided by her coach **Peggy Butkus** and astrologer **Shira Beth Brenner**.

A pivotal moment came when she received her Reiki I initiation at Maha Rose in New York—just two weeks before her father passed away. That initiation opened her clairvoyance, and on the night her father crossed over, she experienced her first psychic vision. In Cyprus, she began writing about her communications with him through clairaudience, producing over 200 pages documenting the healing that unfolded as she learned to listen beyond the veil.

What followed was a three-year quest across the globe in search of spiritual community, healing, and self-discovery:

**Cyprus** — Where she processed her grief and opened to clairaudience

**Greece** — Where she studied astrology with **Kaypacha** (founder of Astrology for the Soul) and uncovered her soul's blueprint

**Nicaragua** — Where she spent a year breaking free from societal constraints and US cultural conditioning, connecting with transformative communities and learning to think freely

**Costa Rica & Mexico** — Where she found her spiritual home

The turning point came when she met **Diego Dosal Stieglitz**, visionary spiritual leader from Mexican high society and founder of Zunya, Costa Rica. Diego introduced her to **Angelina Ataíde** (Angel), a Portuguese spiritual teacher and founder of **Escola da Aura**, centered in the chapadas region of Brazil.

In that moment, Jennifer's path became crystal clear. She had found the modality that would become her life's work.

## A Note on Privilege

Jennifer acknowledges that her healing journey required resources not everyone has access to: the ability to travel internationally, time away from traditional employment, funds for spiritual training and certifications, and a support network that made extended healing work possible.

This path is not the only path. Healing doesn't require expensive retreats, international travel, or prestigious certifications. The core work—naming patterns, regulating your nervous system, reclaiming your worth—can happen with a library book, a journal, free online resources, and one safe person who believes you.

If you're healing without those resources, your journey is no less valid. The practices in this book are designed to be accessible regardless of economic circumstances. Your healing matters whether you do it in Costa Rica or in your living room.

## The Training

Jennifer's journey with Escola da Aura has taken her deep into the practice of aura therapy—a unique modality utilizing clairvoyance to read the auric field and receive messages directly from Source.

In 2025, this journey crystallized into the founding of the International School of Aura and Dreams, Rose OS.

**Influences:**
- Aaron Doughty (mindset and personal development)
- Elizabeth April (psychic training)
- Brandy Joy (Magickal Mystery School, Traditional Hermetic Secret Society)
- Abraham-Hicks, Dr. Michael Newton, Brian Weiss, and Caroline Myss

## Living in Community

Today, Jennifer lives her dream in Costa Rica, on a hill surrounded by lemon trees. She shares this sacred space with her partner **Daniel** (her tech wizard).

Living in community starts with an open heart, and Jennifer is grateful every day for the soul family that surrounds her—including the howler monkeys.

## The Philosophy

At the heart of Jennifer's work is a simple belief:

**Your sensitivity is not your weakness. It's your superpower.**

The same capacity that made you vulnerable to manipulation—your empathy, your attunement, your willingness to see the best in others—is the capacity that will guide you toward healing and help you build the relationships you deserve.

She believes that:

- **Naming patterns creates power.** What you can identify, you can address.
- **The body knows before the mind.** Learning to trust somatic signals is essential.
- **Healing is possible.** No matter how deep the wound, recovery is within reach.
- **Your experience matters.** What happened to you was real, and you deserve validation.
- **Sensitivity is sacred.** It's a gift to be protected, not a flaw to be fixed.
- **Community heals.** We are not meant to do this work alone.

## The Book

*The Narcissism Decoder* represents the distillation of everything Jennifer has learned—from her own journey through narcissistic relationships, from her training in mental health counseling, from years of working with clients, and from the wisdom of survivor communities.

She wrote it for the person she was years ago: confused, self-doubting, and desperately needing someone to explain what was happening. She wrote it for everyone who has been told they were "too sensitive" when they were actually too perceptive. She wrote it as the guide she wished she had found.

Her hope is that these pages bring clarity to your confusion, language to your experience, and—ultimately—freedom from the patterns that have held you.
