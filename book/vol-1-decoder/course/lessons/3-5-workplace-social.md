### Script

We've explored narcissism in family systems and romantic relationships. Now let's look at four other contexts where these patterns appear: the workplace, social relationships, digital spaces, and spiritual communities.

The tactics are the same. The contexts shape how they manifest. As we've said throughout this course: same patterns, different arena.

**WORKPLACE NARCISSISM**

Narcissistic dynamics at work are particularly challenging because you can't just leave. You need the job. You have responsibilities. Walking away has real consequences.

**The narcissistic boss**

This person takes credit for your work. Criticizes you publicly but praises you only privately (if at all). Changes expectations without notice. Has favorites who receive different treatment. Creates anxiety through unpredictability.

You may notice:
- Walking on eggshells around their mood
- Exhaustion beyond what the job requires
- Anxiety that starts Sunday evening and lasts through the week
- Difficulty concentrating because you're tracking their state
- Self-doubt about your competence despite evidence of good work

**The narcissistic colleague**

This person undermines you subtly. Takes credit when things go well; assigns blame when they don't. Charms superiors while treating peers differently. Creates triangulation within teams. Sabotages your work or relationships.

They're often skilled at appearing cooperative while operating competitively.

**The narcissistic culture**

Sometimes the narcissism is systemic. The organization itself operates on narcissistic principles:
- Image over substance
- Punishment for problems rather than solutions
- Scapegoating when things go wrong
- Favoritism rather than merit
- Information hoarding for control

Working in such a culture can be deeply draining even if no single individual is the problem.

**Workplace tactics**

How do the 38 tactics show up at work?

**Gaslighting:** "That's not what was decided in the meeting." "I never said the deadline was Friday." "You're remembering it wrong."

**Credit taking:** Your ideas presented as theirs. Your work invisible; their role emphasized.

**Blame shifting:** When projects fail, you're the reason. When they succeed, it's despite your limitations.

**Moving goalposts:** No matter what you deliver, the requirement changes.

**Isolation:** They limit your access to colleagues, resources, or decision-makers.

**Smear campaigns:** Your reputation damaged before you realize there's a conversation happening.

**Intermittent reinforcement:** Praise one week, criticism the next. You never know where you stand.

**Workplace protection strategies**

You can't always leave, but you can protect yourself:

**Document everything.** Emails, meeting notes, decisions, deliverables. Create a paper trail.

**Communicate in writing.** Follow up verbal conversations with email summaries: "To confirm what we discussed..."

**Build relationships laterally.** Allies matter. Don't let them isolate you.

**Know your worth externally.** Keep your resume current. Know what options exist.

**Set internal boundaries.** You may not be able to change them, but you can manage your exposure.

**Protect your mental health.** This is a job. It's not your identity. Find support outside work.

**SOCIAL NARCISSISM**

Narcissism in friendships and social circles operates differently because the ties are theoretically voluntary—though they often don't feel that way.

**The narcissistic friend**

This person is charming, often the center of the group. But notice:
- Conversations always come back to them
- Your problems are minimized; theirs are urgent
- They're different with you one-on-one versus in groups
- They keep score and invoke "obligations"
- Drama seems to follow them; they're always the victim

The relationship is draining even though nothing overtly terrible happens.

**The narcissistic group dynamic**

Some friend groups develop narcissistic patterns:
- An alpha who controls social capital
- Scapegoats who absorb group tension
- Triangulation and gossip as communication
- Competition for the alpha's approval
- Fear of exclusion that keeps everyone compliant

You may have friends you like individually who are difficult in the group context.

**Social tactics**

**Triangulation:** Telling you what someone else "said" about you. Positioning themselves at the center of information flow.

**Silent treatment:** Freezing you out with no explanation. Making you chase reconnection.

**Comparison:** Subtle digs about your life relative to others. Making you feel inadequate.

**Future faking:** Plans that never materialize. Promises that aren't kept.

**Obligation creation:** Doing favors you didn't ask for, then calling in debts.

**Gatekeeping:** Controlling access to the group, to information, to social opportunity.

**Social protection strategies**

**Evaluate the cost-benefit.** Is this friendship serving you? What does it cost? What does it provide?

**Notice patterns, not incidents.** One disappointment is human. A pattern of disappointment is data.

**Protect your energy.** You can choose proximity. Not everyone deserves close access.

**Build diverse connections.** Don't depend on one group. Have multiple communities.

**Trust slow.** Let people earn trust over time through consistent behavior.

**Permit yourself to leave.** You don't owe anyone a friendship that drains you.

**DIGITAL MANIPULATION**

Same patterns, different arena.

Everything we've learned about manipulation operates online too. The tactics aren't new—they're just adapted to digital environments where communication is constant and boundaries are harder to maintain.

**Online relationship patterns**

Digital spaces create unique vulnerabilities:
- Constant availability creates pressure to respond immediately
- Text lacks tone, enabling plausible deniability for hurtful messages
- Social media provides tools for surveillance and triangulation
- Online personas can differ dramatically from reality
- The illusion of intimacy develops faster than trust should allow

**Digital-specific tactics**

**Breadcrumbing:** Sending just enough attention to keep you interested without real commitment. Occasional likes, sporadic messages, just enough to prevent you from moving on.

**Ghosting as punishment:** Disappearing without explanation to punish, then returning as if nothing happened.

**Social media surveillance:** Monitoring your activity, your friends, your likes. Knowing where you are without being told.

**Digital triangulation:** Posting with others to provoke jealousy. Strategic likes and comments. Making sure you see their "amazing life" without you.

**Screenshot threats:** Using recorded conversations as leverage. "I'll share this with everyone."

**Love bombing via text:** Overwhelming messages, constant contact, creating a sense of intense connection before meeting in person.

**Online smear campaigns:** Attacking your reputation in spaces where you can't defend yourself.

**Digital protection strategies**

**Delay responses.** You don't owe immediate replies. The 3-3-3 Rule works for texts too.

**Trust slowly online.** Anyone can curate a persona. Look for consistency over time.

**Protect your digital footprint.** Be intentional about what you share and who can see it.

**Screenshot your own records.** Document concerning conversations.

**Block without guilt.** You can remove access. It's not dramatic; it's boundaries.

**Notice the feeling.** How do you feel after checking their social media? After reading their messages? Your body knows.

**RELIGIOUS AND SPIRITUAL CONTEXTS**

Narcissistic dynamics also appear in religious communities and spiritual relationships. These contexts add complexity because spiritual authority creates additional power imbalances.

**Spiritual manipulation patterns**

**Spiritual bypassing:** Using spiritual concepts to avoid accountability. "Everything happens for a reason." "You need to forgive and let go." "Your ego is the problem."

**Divine authority claims:** "God told me..." "I received a message that you should..." Using claimed spiritual access to control others.

**Conditional belonging:** Your place in the community depends on compliance. Questions are framed as lack of faith.

**Confession as leverage:** Information shared in spiritual confidence used for control.

**Shunning and exclusion:** Community rejection for boundary-setting or questioning.

> **Note:** Healthy spirituality supports growth, questions, and individual discernment. If your spiritual community requires you to abandon critical thinking or punishes you for setting boundaries, the dynamic has become coercive.

**The decoder in daily life**

What you've learned in this course applies everywhere:

- The tactics are the same across contexts
- Your body's signals work everywhere
- The 3-3-3 Rule works in any situation
- Patterns matter more than incidents
- You can trust your perception

Module 3 is complete. You now understand how narcissistic dynamics operate across the major contexts of your life.

In Module 4, we'll give you quick-reference decoder cards—tools you can use in real-time to recognize and respond.

## Exercise

**Context Pattern Recognition**

**Part 1: Workplace Assessment**

Rate your workplace experience (0 = not present, 5 = frequent):

| Pattern | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| Unpredictable moods affecting the team | /5 |
| Credit-taking by superiors or colleagues | /5 |
| Blame-shifting when things go wrong | /5 |
| Moving goalposts or changing expectations | /5 |
| Information used for control | /5 |
| Anxiety disproportionate to actual demands | /5 |

If multiple items are 3+, consider documenting and developing an exit strategy.

**Part 2: Social Circle Assessment**

Think about your friend groups and social circles:

| Pattern | Rating |
|---------|--------|
| One person always at the center | /5 |
| Gossip and triangulation common | /5 |
| Competition for approval or attention | /5 |
| Fear of exclusion affecting behavior | /5 |
| Drama that follows the same person | /5 |
| Feeling drained after social time | /5 |

If multiple items are 3+, consider the cost-benefit of these relationships.

**Part 3: Action Planning**

- What workplace boundary could you strengthen?
- What social relationship might need reconsideration?
- What protection strategy will you implement first?
