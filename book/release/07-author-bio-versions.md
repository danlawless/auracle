## Short Bio (100 words)

*For: Amazon KDP, back of book, podcast introductions*

Jennifer Brooke Lawless holds a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and a Master of Science in Mental Health Counseling. She spent years in traditional talk therapy before her own healing journey led her beyond the therapy room. After surviving narcissistic relationships and navigating a profound spiritual awakening, she traveled globally—Cyprus, Greece, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Mexico—seeking community and transformation. She now lives in Costa Rica, where she co-hosts transformative retreats at Zunya and trains in aura therapy through Escola da Aura. She wrote *The Narcissism Decoder* and *The Bridge* because she needed these books—and couldn't find them.

## Medium Bio (200 words)

*For: Gumroad, Substack About page, guest post bylines*

Jennifer Brooke Lawless holds a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and a Master of Science in Mental Health Counseling, and has spent years working at the intersection of traditional psychology and spiritual healing. Her journey from feardom to freedom began when she finally named the patterns that had kept her small—narcissistic relationships, approval-seeking, chronic self-doubt, and the belief that her sensitivity was a flaw rather than a gift.

After the death of her father, Jennifer experienced a powerful Kundalini awakening that opened her to new levels of consciousness. What followed was three years of global travel—Cyprus, Greece, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Mexico—searching for the spiritual community and healing modalities that would become her life's work.

Today, Jennifer lives in Costa Rica surrounded by community, where she co-hosts transformative retreats at Zunya and trains in aura therapy through Escola da Aura. She is particularly passionate about helping emotionally sensitive adults move from survival to sovereign connection.

She wrote *The Narcissism Decoder* and *The Bridge* because she needed them—and when she couldn't find the book that bridged insight and embodiment, she created it.

## Long Bio (400 words)

*For: Website, press kit, speaking engagements*

Jennifer Brooke Lawless is a healer, writer, and event producer dedicated to helping emotionally sensitive adults recognize manipulation, heal attachment wounds, and build relationships that regulate rather than activate.

She holds a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and a Master of Science in Mental Health Counseling, and spent years working in traditional talk therapy. But her own healing required more than insight—it required a complete rewiring of how she related to herself, others, and the world. Her journey from feardom to freedom became the foundation for everything she now teaches.

### The Turning Point

After her father's passing, Jennifer experienced a Kundalini awakening that cracked open her consciousness. What followed was three years of global travel—Cyprus, Greece, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Mexico—in search of healing, community, and her soul's purpose. She wrote over 200 pages communicating with her father through clairaudience. She studied astrology with Kaypacha. She trained in shadow work through the Transitions program with Diego Dosal, a visionary leader from Mexican high society.

Through this journey, she had to face her own patterns: passive-aggression, approval-seeking, shrinking in narcissistic relationships, years of depression and anxiety, and the mortally wounded self-esteem that came from a lifetime of emotional enmeshment.

### The Work Today

Jennifer now lives in Costa Rica, where she co-hosts transformative retreats at Zunya—immersive experiences combining energy healing, meditation, aura readings, and community. She continues her training in aura therapy through Escola da Aura under the guidance of Angelina Ataíde, a Portuguese spiritual teacher, and her daily practice includes Qi Gong, Tai Chi, Reiki, and meditation.

Her books—*The Narcissism Decoder* and *The Bridge*—were born from lived experience, not clinical distance. She wrote them because she needed them. Because insight alone hadn't healed her. Because she couldn't find the book that bridged understanding and embodiment—so she created it.

### Philosophy

Jennifer believes that naming patterns breaks their power. That secure attachment is practiced, not found. That sensitivity is not a weakness but a survival adaptation that can be redirected. And that healing happens through consistent, gentle practice—not more analysis.
