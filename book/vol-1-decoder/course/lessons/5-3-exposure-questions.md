### Script

Sometimes the most powerful tool isn't a response—it's a question.

The Exposure Questions are strategic inquiries designed to reveal narcissistic patterns. They work because healthy people answer them easily, while those with narcissistic patterns struggle, deflect, or expose themselves.

These questions aren't accusations. They're invitations to self-reflection—invitations that narcissists cannot accept without revealing their nature.

**Why questions work**

Narcissistic manipulation relies on controlling the frame. When you respond, you're operating within their frame—defending, explaining, reacting.

Questions shift the frame. Suddenly they're the one responding. And their response reveals who they are.

A healthy person can answer: "What's your part in this?"
A narcissist cannot—because accepting any fault is intolerable.

That difference is diagnostic.

**The Master Question**

If you could only ask one question to identify a narcissist, it would be this:

**"When was the last time you were genuinely wrong about something, admitted it without being forced to, and changed your behavior as a result?"**

Let that question sink in.

A healthy person:
- Can produce a specific, recent example
- Shows genuine reflection
- Demonstrates how they changed
- May even be slightly uncomfortable (because no one likes being wrong)

A person with narcissistic patterns will:
- Struggle to find any example
- Deflect: "I'm wrong all the time, I admit it constantly" (but no specific example)
- Reverse: "Why are you asking me this? What about you?"
- Produce an example where they were actually right all along
- Get angry at the question itself

The question reveals whether someone can genuinely self-reflect and take accountability. Narcissists cannot—because admitting genuine fault feels like annihilation.

**Additional Exposure Questions**

Here are more questions that reveal narcissistic patterns:

---

**About empathy:**
"How do you think I'm feeling right now?"

Healthy answer: Attempts to name your feeling, shows interest in your experience.

Narcissistic answer: Dismisses ("I don't know"), reverses ("How do you think I feel?"), or gets it completely wrong with no self-correction.

---

**About accountability:**
"What's your part in this conflict?"

Healthy answer: Identifies specific things they contributed, even if they also think you contributed.

Narcissistic answer: Everything is your fault. Their part is either nonexistent or minimal. "I guess I shouldn't have tried to help you."

---

**About difference:**
"It's okay if we disagree about this."

Healthy answer: Agrees that difference is acceptable. Can move forward without forcing agreement.

Narcissistic answer: Cannot tolerate the difference. Must convince you. Sees your differing view as an attack.

---

**About mistakes:**
"Tell me about a time you hurt someone and took responsibility."

Healthy answer: Specific example with reflection, perhaps visible discomfort.

Narcissistic answer: Can't think of one. Or tells a story where they were actually the victim. Or describes taking responsibility that sounds more like an apology that wasn't accepted.

---

**About your experience:**
"What do you think my experience of this relationship is?"

Healthy answer: Shows understanding of your perspective, even if imperfect. Demonstrates interest.

Narcissistic answer: Either dismissive ("How would I know?"), self-focused ("Well, you should be grateful"), or reveals they've never genuinely considered your experience.

---

**About needs:**
"What are three things that are important to me?"

Healthy answer: Can name specific things, may check with you, shows they've been paying attention.

Narcissistic answer: Generic guesses, reversals ("What about what's important to ME?"), or visible struggle to name anything specific about you.

**When to use these questions**

These questions serve different purposes:

**For evaluation:** When you're unsure if someone's patterns are concerning, these questions can clarify. Use them early in relationships, during the evaluation phase.

**For confirmation:** When you already suspect narcissism but second-guess yourself, their answers confirm what you're seeing.

**For reality testing:** When you've been gaslit and doubt your perception, their inability to answer reveals the truth.

**For exit preparation:** Before making a major decision about the relationship, their answers can provide clarity and reduce doubt.

**How to ask**

The tone matters.

Don't ask accusingly: "I bet you can't even tell me when you were wrong."

Ask curiously: "I'm curious—when was the last time you were wrong about something?"

The curious tone gives them every opportunity to answer well. A healthy person will. A narcissist will expose themselves even with the generous framing.

Keep your energy neutral. Don't telegraph that this is a test. Present it as genuine curiosity.

And then: watch carefully. Notice the micro-expressions. The hesitation. The shift toward defensiveness or attack. The answer—or the inability to answer—tells you everything.

**What to do with the answers**

If they answer well—with specificity, reflection, genuine self-awareness—that's important data. It doesn't mean they're perfect, but it suggests capacity for accountability and growth.

If they can't answer—if they deflect, attack, minimize, reverse—that's also data. It tells you what you're dealing with.

You don't have to announce what you've learned. You don't have to confront them with their failure to answer. That would just create conflict without benefit.

Simply take the information and use it for your own discernment.

**The 72-Hour Test**

One more tool: the 72-Hour Test.

Before making any major decision about a person—especially an intimate one—wait 72 hours.

Love-bombing neurochemistry takes time to settle. Patterns invisible in excitement become visible in calm. The version of yourself that emerges after the intensity fades is the version to trust.

When someone has been particularly charming, persuasive, or intense—wait. Watch. Let time do its revealing work.

**In our final lesson,** we'll talk about moving forward—how to close this chapter and begin the next one.

## Exercise

**Exposure Question Practice**

**Part 1: Familiarization**

Memorize these key questions:
1. The Master Question: "When was the last time you were genuinely wrong, admitted it, and changed?"
2. The Empathy Check: "How do you think I'm feeling right now?"
3. The Accountability Check: "What's your part in this?"
4. The Interest Check: "What are three things that are important to me?"

**Part 2: Retrospective Analysis**

Think of someone you're uncertain about. Mentally answer:
- Could they answer the Master Question genuinely?
- Have you seen them take real accountability?
- Do they show genuine interest in your experience?

What does this tell you?

**Part 3: Future Application**

Choose one relationship where you want more clarity.

- Which question would be most revealing?
- When could you naturally ask it?
- How will you stay neutral and curious?
- What will you do with the answer?
