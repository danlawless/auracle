## Course Modules

### Module 1: The Helper's Journey
**Lessons:** 5 | **Duration:** ~2 hours

Understanding why we're drawn to help—and the shadows that come with it.

| Lesson | Title | Duration |
|--------|-------|----------|
| 1.1 | The Guide's Manifesto | 15 min |
| 1.2 | Why Survivors Become Helpers | 25 min |
| 1.3 | When Helping Is Hiding | 25 min |
| 1.4 | The Rescuer's Trap | 30 min |
| 1.5 | Need to Be Needed | 25 min |

**Key Scripts:**

**Lesson 1.3: When Helping Is Hiding**
> Sometimes we help others to avoid our own work. When we're focused on someone else's healing, we don't have to face our own unfinished business. Helping can become a socially acceptable way to dissociate from our own pain. The guide who hasn't faced this shadow will unconsciously use their clients for regulation, validation, or purpose. Awareness is the antidote.

**Lesson 1.4: The Rescuer's Trap**
> The rescuer believes: "If I can save them, I will be okay." But people can't be rescued—they can only be supported in rescuing themselves. When we rescue, we create dependency. We steal their agency. And we tie our worth to their transformation. True guidance means tolerating the discomfort of watching someone struggle while offering support—not solutions.

**Lessons:** 4 | **Duration:** ~1.5 hours

Scope of practice, dual relationships, and story stewardship.

| Lesson | Title | Duration |
|--------|-------|----------|
| 3.1 | Scope of Practice | 25 min |
| 3.2 | The Ethics of Lived Experience | 25 min |
| 3.3 | When to Refer | 25 min |
| 3.4 | Dual Relationships and Boundary Complexity | 25 min |

**Key Scripts:**

**Lesson 3.2: The Ethics of Lived Experience**
> Your healing is your credential—but it's not your only credential. Lived experience gives you insight, empathy, and resonance. It doesn't automatically give you the skills to hold others safely. The ethical practitioner knows what their experience qualifies them for and what requires additional training. They don't project their journey onto others or assume their path is universal.
