# Review Round 3 - Implementation Workflow Order

**Created:** January 4, 2026
**Template:** Based on [`book/agents/review-workflow-template.md`](../../agents/review-workflow-template.md)
**Principle:** Big-picture changes first, fine details last — structural changes invalidate detailed polish work.

---

## Phase 1: Strategic Decisions (Do First)

These set the direction. Answer ALL questions in Phase 1 before implementing changes.

| Order | Status | Agent | Issue | Questions | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | [x] | **Diana** (Developmental Editor) | [#214](https://github.com/danlawless/auracle/issues/214) | 25 | Structure, themes, narrative arc |
| 2 | [x] | **Morgan** (Managing Editor) | [#211](https://github.com/danlawless/auracle/issues/211) | 14 | Priorities, conflicts, coordination |

**Phase 1 Complete:** [x] January 4, 2026
**Structural changes implemented:** [x]

## Phase 2: Content & Experience

Address after Phase 1 structural decisions are made. These can be answered in parallel.

| Order | Status | Agent | Issue | Questions | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| 3 | [x] | **Bailey** (Beta Reader) | [#212](https://github.com/danlawless/auracle/issues/212) | 56 | Reader engagement, pacing, clarity |
| 4 | [x] | **Sage** (Sensitivity Reader) | [#216](https://github.com/danlawless/auracle/issues/216) | 18 | Representation, inclusion, trauma-informed |
| 5 | [x] | **Felix** (Fact-Checker) | [#209](https://github.com/danlawless/auracle/issues/209) | 6 | Sources, accuracy, verification |

**Phase 2 Complete:** [x] January 4, 2026
**Content changes implemented:** [x]

---

## Phase 3: Polish

Only begin after content is stable. Lydia first, then Clara.

| Order | Status | Agent | Issue | Questions | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| 6 | [ ] | **Lydia** (Line Editor) | [#210](https://github.com/danlawless/auracle/issues/210) | 18 | Prose craft, voice, rhythm |
| 7 | [ ] | **Clara** (Copy Editor) | [#213](https://github.com/danlawless/auracle/issues/213) | 28 | Style consistency, terminology |

**Phase 3 Complete:** [ ]
**Polish changes implemented:** [ ]

---

## Phase 4: Final Pass

Absolutely last — any earlier changes could introduce new errors.

| Order | Status | Agent | Issue | Questions | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| 8 | [ ] | **Petra** (Proofreader) | [#215](https://github.com/danlawless/auracle/issues/215) | 5 | Typos, formatting, final errors |

**Phase 4 Complete:** [ ]
**Final corrections applied:** [ ]

## Summary

| Phase | Issues | Total Questions | Status |
|-------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 - Strategic | #214, #211 | 39 | [x] Complete |
| 2 - Content | #212, #216, #209 | 80 | [x] Complete |
| 3 - Polish | #210, #213 | 46 | [ ] Active |
| 4 - Final | #215 | 5 | [ ] Pending |
| **TOTAL** | **8 issues** | **170 questions** | |

## Parallel Work Guide

**Can answer together:**
- Diana + Morgan (but answer both before implementing)
- Bailey + Sage + Felix (different concerns)
- Lydia + Clara (but implement Lydia's first)

**Must be sequential:**
- Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4
- Petra absolutely last
