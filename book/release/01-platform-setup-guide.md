About: Weekly insights on recognizing manipulation, healing attachment 
wounds, and building relationships that regulate rather than activate.

Posting Schedule: Weekly (same day each week)
```

### Free vs Paid

Start with **free only** to build audience. Add paid tier later when you have:
- 1,000+ free subscribers
- Consistent engagement
- Additional content to offer (deep dives, Q&A, community)

- Cross-promote books in every 3rd-4th newsletter

```

### TikTok (Alternative)

1. Create account

3. Plan for video content from book material

### Content Approach

- **Frequency:** 3-5 posts per week minimum
- **Format:** Quote cards, carousel tips, short videos
- **Hashtags:** #narcissisticabuse #traumahealing #attachmentstyles #toxicrelationships

```
Discovery Path:
Social Media → Substack (free newsletter) → Gumroad (paid books)
