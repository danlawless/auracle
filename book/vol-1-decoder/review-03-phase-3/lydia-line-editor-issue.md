## Questions for Author Decision

### Category A: Voice & Consistency (Q1-Q3)

#### Q1: Intentional "we" usage

There are occasional shifts from "you" to "we" (e.g., "We are not meant to do this work alone"). Are these intentional moments of solidarity, or would you prefer consistent "you" throughout?

- [ ] A) Keep "we" shifts as intentional solidarity moments
- [ ] B) Standardize to "you" throughout
- [ ] C) Review case-by-case and decide
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

---

#### Q2: Field Notes voice shift

Chapter 10's Field Notes sections shift to third person ("She is young..."). Previous reviews flagged this. Is this voice shift serving a specific purpose (creating distance for processing difficult material), or would you prefer consistency with second person?

- [ ] A) Keep third person in Field Notes (intentional distance)
- [ ] B) Convert to second person for consistency
- [ ] C) Keep third person but add framing note
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

---

#### Q3: Clinical vs. conversational tone

Some sections lean more clinical (particularly trauma bonding explanations), others more conversational. Is this rhythmic variation intentional, or would you like more consistency?

- [ ] A) Variation is intentional — clinical for science, conversational for support
- [ ] B) Lean more clinical throughout
- [ ] C) Lean more conversational throughout
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

---

### Category B: Rhythm & Structure (Q4-Q5)

#### Q4: Rhythm variation in lists

Chapter 14 (Decoder Cards) contains extensive lists that create visual density. Would you consider breaking some of the longer cards into subsections, or is the current density intentional for reference purposes?

- [ ] A) Keep current density (reference format)
- [ ] B) Add subsection breaks for longer cards
- [ ] C) Review longest cards individually
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

---

#### Q5: Pause Points effectiveness

The "Pause Point" breaks in Chapter 14 are excellent. Would you consider adding similar breaks in other dense chapters (e.g., Chapter 3)?

- [ ] A) Yes, add Pause Points to Chapter 3 and other dense chapters
- [ ] B) Chapter 3 pause points already planned (Phase 2 decision)
- [ ] C) Current distribution is sufficient
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

**Note:** Phase 2 (Bailey Q1) already approved adding pause points every 8-10 tactics in Chapter 3.

---

### Category C: Word Choice (Q6-Q8)

#### Q6: "Here's" as transition

"Here's" appears as a conversational bridge throughout (e.g., "Here's where it gets biological," "Here's what helps"). Is this voice marker intentional, or would you like more variety in these transitions?

- [ ] A) Intentional voice marker — keep as-is
- [ ] B) Reduce frequency, vary transitions
- [ ] C) Review and vary only where repetitive
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

---

#### Q7: Contraction consistency

Some sections use "isn't/doesn't" while others use "is not/does not." Is there a pattern to this (e.g., more formal in clinical sections), or would you prefer standardization?

- [ ] A) Intentional pattern — contractions conversational, full forms clinical
- [ ] B) Standardize to contractions throughout
- [ ] C) Standardize to full forms throughout
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

---

Em-dashes appear 2-3 times per page on average. Is this rhythmic choice intentional for the conversational tone, or would you like to reduce further?

- [ ] A) Current frequency is intentional
- [ ] B) Reduce to 1-2 per page (50% reduction per Phase 1)
- [ ] C) Reduce further
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

**Note:** Phase 1 approved 50% em-dash reduction target.

---

### Category D: Metaphor & Imagery (Q9-Q10)

#### Q9: Extended metaphors

Some metaphors (like "The Gradual Dimming" and "Wolf in Sheep's Clothing") get extended development. Others appear once. Is this variation intentional — using some as teaching tools and others as quick illustrations?

- [ ] A) Intentional — core metaphors extended, others quick illustrations
- [ ] B) Extend more metaphors for consistency
- [ ] C) Reduce extended metaphors
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

---

#### Q10: Frequency/energy language

Chapter 2 uses "frequency" and "energy" language ("rewrite the room's frequency," "energetic signature"). Some readers may find this language spiritual/woo, others find it precisely accurate. Is this intentional vocabulary for the target audience?

- [ ] A) Intentional — resonates with target audience
- [ ] B) Reduce spiritual/energy language

- [ ] B) Add brief forward-looking paragraph
- [ ] C) Add epilogue
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

---

- [ ] B) Keep as separate interlude chapters
- [ ] C) Remove from manuscript
- [ ] D) Other: _____________

**Note:** Phase 1 decided to integrate pause files into chapter endings.

- [ ] B) Add options where currently single response
- [ ] C) Reduce to single best response throughout

## Patterns to Preserve

Lydia identified these as working exceptionally well — no changes recommended:

1. **Second-person direct address** — creates intimacy and validation
2. **"What it feels like in your body" sections** — signature feature
3. **"This isn't X. It's Y." contrast pattern** — powerful teaching
4. **Decoder card structure** — consistent, scannable, actionable
5. **Short sentence for emphasis** — creates rhythm and impact
6. **Pull quotes in italics** — visual and conceptual breaks
7. **Power Move sections** — empowering and practical
8. **Question-then-answer structure** — engages reader
9. **Body-based metaphors** — vivid and specific
10. **Tactical protocols** — concrete, actionable, grounding

---

## Overall Assessment

**Grade: A**

This is sophisticated, accomplished prose at the sentence level. The voice is strong and consistent. The rhythm varies effectively. Word choice is precise and active. Metaphors are fresh and embodied.

The questions above are not about problems — they're about refinement and clarifying intentional choices. This manuscript demonstrates mastery of line-level craft.
