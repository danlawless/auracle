# Book Editing Agents

AI-powered editorial assistants for the complete book editing workflow. Each agent specializes in a different stage of the editorial process, from big-picture development to final proofreading.

## The Editorial Workflow

Book editing happens in stages, each building on the previous. Running these in order produces the best results.

## When to Use Each Agent

### Developmental Editor
Invoke first, after your initial draft is complete. Use when you need feedback on:
- Overall structure and organization
- Narrative arc and pacing
- Character development and consistency
- Theme development
- Chapter organization and flow
- Major plot or argument issues

### Line Editor
Invoke after developmental edits are complete and structure is solid. Use when:
- Prose needs polishing at the sentence level
- Voice needs strengthening or consistency
- Dialogue feels flat or unnatural
- Transitions between sections need work
- Word choice could be more precise or evocative

### Copy Editor
Invoke when content is finalized and you need technical polish. Use for:
- Grammar and punctuation review
- Spelling and syntax errors
- Style guide adherence
- Internal consistency (timeline, character details, facts)
- Creating a style sheet for the manuscript

### Proofreader
Invoke as the final pass before publication. Use for:
- Catching remaining typos
- Formatting consistency
- Layout issues (widows, orphans, spacing)
- Final quality check

### Sensitivity Reader
Invoke when your work includes representation of marginalized identities, cultures, or experiences. Use for:
- Checking authentic representation
- Identifying harmful stereotypes
- Verifying cultural accuracy
- Ensuring respectful language

### Fact-Checker
Invoke for non-fiction, memoir, historical fiction, or any work with verifiable claims. Use for:
- Verifying dates and timelines
- Checking names and titles
- Confirming quotes and attributions
- Validating statistics and data
- Verifying locations and historical details

### Beta Reader
Invoke when you want reader-perspective feedback before professional editing. Use for:
- Reader engagement assessment
- Identifying confusion points
- Emotional impact feedback
- Pacing feel from a reader's perspective
- Target audience alignment

### Managing Editor
Invoke to coordinate the overall editing process. Use for:
- Planning the editorial workflow
- Tracking progress across passes
- Deciding which editor to invoke next
- Maintaining consistency across editing stages
- Resolving conflicting feedback

## Cost Expectations

Different editing passes have different scope and cost:
- **Developmental**: $0.03-0.10/word (most intensive, strategic)
- **Line editing**: $0.02-0.05/word (craft-focused)
- **Copy editing**: $0.01-0.03/word (technical precision)
- **Proofreading**: $0.005-0.02/word (final pass)
- **Sensitivity reading**: Varies by scope
- **Fact-checking**: Varies by density of claims

These AI agents can help reduce costs while maintaining quality, but human editors remain valuable for nuanced judgment calls.
