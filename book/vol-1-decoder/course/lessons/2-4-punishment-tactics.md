### Script

So far, we've covered tactics that attack your perception and hijack your emotions. Those tactics work through destabilization—they create confusion and dependency.

But what happens when destabilization isn't enough? When you start to push back, to set boundaries, to wake up?

That's when punishment and control tactics emerge.

These are the enforcement mechanisms. They're designed to make independence costly.

**Tactic 20: Rage**

Explosive anger that shuts down conversation and creates fear.

It might come as sudden yelling. Throwing things. Punching walls. Threatening posture. The specific form doesn't matter—the function is the same.

Rage creates fear. Fear shuts down your thinking brain. In the presence of rage, you focus on one thing: survival. Getting the rage to stop.

This is why you apologize for things that weren't your fault. This is why you don't bring up topics that might "set them off." This is why you walk on eggshells.

**The decoder:** Rage is never justified as a response to normal conflict. If you're afraid of their anger, that fear is telling you something important about the relationship.

**Tactic 21: Withholding**

Strategically denying something you need—affection, attention, resources, sex, communication—as punishment.

"I would be more affectionate if you weren't so difficult."
"Maybe if you were nicer, I'd want to spend time with you."

Withholding creates scarcity. When connection becomes scarce, you value any crumb you receive. You modify your behavior to increase the chance of receiving what you need.

This is how you become trained.

**The decoder:** Healthy partners want to meet each other's needs. If connection or resources are consistently framed as rewards for compliance, that's a control structure, not a relationship.

**Tactic 22: Threats**

Implied or explicit statements about negative consequences.

Sometimes it's direct: "If you leave, I'll make sure you never see the kids."
Sometimes it's vague: "You'll regret this."
Sometimes it's self-directed: "If you go, I don't know what I'll do to myself."

Threats keep you paralyzed. They make change feel impossibly dangerous.

**The decoder:** Anyone who uses threats to control your behavior is showing you who they are. Document everything. Seek support. Make safety plans.

**Tactic 23: Financial Control**

Using money as a mechanism for control.

This might mean controlling access to shared finances. Creating debt dependency. Sabotaging your employment. Making you account for every purchase. Using financial support as leverage.

When you don't have independent financial access, leaving becomes logistically impossible.

**The decoder:** Financial partnership involves shared access and joint decision-making. If one person controls all financial resources and the other must ask permission, that's financial abuse, not partnership.

**Tactic 24: Monitoring and Surveillance**

Tracking your location, reading your messages, checking your social media, demanding to know your whereabouts constantly.

It's often framed as concern: "I worry about you."
Or as reasonable expectation: "We're in a relationship—you shouldn't have secrets."

But the function is control. If you know you're being watched, you modify your behavior. You become your own jailer.

**The decoder:** Privacy exists in healthy relationships. If you're not allowed to have any thoughts, messages, or moments that aren't scrutinized, that's surveillance, not intimacy.

**Tactic 25: Stonewalling**

Refusing to engage with any conversation about problems.

Different from silent treatment—which is punishment through withdrawal—stonewalling is the refusal to participate in relationship repair.

"I'm not talking about this."
"There's nothing to discuss."
*Walking away mid-conversation.*
*Complete shutdown when difficult topics arise.*

If you can't address problems, problems can't be solved. The relationship stays exactly where they want it.

**The decoder:** Healthy relationships require both people willing to work through difficulty. If one person systematically prevents repair conversations, the relationship cannot improve.

**Tactic 26: Smear Campaigns**

Damaging your reputation before you can share your side.

As you start to pull away or set boundaries, they tell others their version first. They position themselves as the victim. They describe you as unstable, crazy, abusive.

When you finally talk about what happened, people already have a narrative. Your credibility is pre-damaged.

**The decoder:** If you discover they've been telling others about your "problems" or painting you negatively behind your back, this isn't venting—it's strategy.

**Tactic 27: Enlisting Allies**

Recruiting others to pressure you on their behalf.

"Even your mother thinks you're being unreasonable."
Friends or family suddenly express concern about your behavior—using phrases you recognize from the manipulator.
People you trusted seem to have been briefed against you.

Flying monkeys—that's the term. People who do the manipulator's bidding, often without realizing they're being used.

**The decoder:** When multiple people suddenly echo the same concerns in similar language, trace it back. Who talked to them? Whose narrative are they repeating?

**Tactic 28: Punishment Framing as Care**

"I'm doing this for your own good."
"This hurts me more than it hurts you."
"Someday you'll thank me."

The punishment is reframed as love. Criticism becomes "helping you improve." Control becomes "protecting you." Rage becomes "passion."

This is one of the most confusing tactics because it hijacks the concept of care itself.

**The decoder:** Real care doesn't feel like punishment. If their "love" consistently hurts, it's not love—it's control in a costume.

**The escalation pattern**

Here's something important to understand: These tactics often escalate.

Early in a relationship, you might see mild versions. Pouting instead of rage. Small financial control instead of complete restriction.

As you become more attached—or as you start to resist—the tactics intensify.

Think of this like a gradual dimming of the lights. If someone suddenly turned off all the lights, you'd notice immediately. But if the lights dimmed one percent every hour, your eyes would adjust. You'd start to think this was normal. By the time you were in near-darkness, you might not even remember what bright felt like.

You may have adapted to a level of control that would have been unacceptable at the start. That adaptation doesn't mean it's okay. It means you've been conditioned.

**When you see punishment tactics**

If punishment and control tactics are present in your relationship, please hear this:

This is serious.

Destabilization tactics can exist in unhealthy but non-dangerous relationships. Punishment tactics cross a line into coercive control.

If you're experiencing these patterns:
- Document what's happening
- Build connections outside the relationship
- Create a safety plan
- Seek professional support

You may need to leave. Leaving may be dangerous. You deserve support.

**In our next lesson,** we'll cover Identity and Isolation Tactics—how manipulation systematically shrinks who you are.
