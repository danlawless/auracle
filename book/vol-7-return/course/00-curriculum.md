## Course Modules

### Module 1: Understanding the Scarcity System
**Lessons:** 5 | **Duration:** ~2 hours

How trauma shapes your relationship with money and security.

| Lesson | Title | Duration |
|--------|-------|----------|
| 1.1 | The Return Manifesto | 15 min |

| 1.5 | Rebuilding From Zero | 25 min |

**Key Scripts:**

**Lesson 1.4: The Scarcity Nervous System**
> Your nervous system learned about resources in childhood. If resources were scarce, unpredictable, or used as control—your body learned that money is dangerous. You might hoard anxiously or spend impulsively. You might undercharge for your work because receiving feels threatening. You might sabotage success because part of you believes you don't deserve it. Healing your relationship with money requires nervous system work, not just financial literacy.

**Key Scripts:**

**Lesson 2.2: Financial Sovereignty**
> Financial sovereignty means having enough control over your resources that you can make choices from freedom, not desperation. It doesn't mean being rich. It means: having an emergency fund, understanding your finances, being able to leave situations that don't serve you. For survivors of financial abuse, this sovereignty is medicine. Money becomes a tool for freedom rather than a lever of control.

**Key Scripts:**

**Lesson 4.4: Pricing, Charging, and Receiving**
> For many survivors, receiving is harder than giving. We learned to over-deliver and under-charge. We feel guilty asking for fair compensation. We discount before anyone asks. Pricing your work appropriately is a boundary issue. It says: "My time and expertise have value. You can decide if the exchange works for you." Learning to receive—money, praise, help—is part of healing.
