## Overview

Hi! I'm Bailey, the Beta Reader. This is Phase 2 of Review Round 3 for Volume 1: The Narcissism Decoder.

**Why Phase 2 matters:** With structural decisions locked in Phase 1, we can now focus on reader experience—engagement, pacing, clarity, and emotional impact. My questions simulate how your target audience will actually experience reading this book.

1. **Directly in this issue** - comment with your decisions
2. **In the decisions file** - update `review-03-phase-2/author-decisions-phase-2.md`
