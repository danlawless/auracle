### Script

You understand the patterns. You can recognize the tactics. Your nervous system has tools to regulate.

Now: what do you actually say?

This lesson gives you practical scripts—tested responses you can use in the moment when manipulation is happening.

**The response philosophy**

Before we get to specific scripts, understand the underlying principles:

**Less is more.** Brief responses give them less material to work with. "I'll think about that" is often better than a detailed explanation.

**Don't JADE.** JADE stands for Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain. When you JADE, you're operating within their frame. You're treating their challenge as legitimate. Most of the time, you don't need to.

**State, don't debate.** State your position. Don't debate its validity. "I'm not comfortable with that" requires no defense.

**You can leave.** Disengaging is always an option. "I'm going to end this conversation" is a complete response.

**They won't like it.** Any effective response will be met with escalation, at least initially. That's expected. It's not evidence that you did something wrong.

**The Universal Responses**

These work for almost any manipulation tactic:

**"I'll think about that."**
This buys time without agreement. It sounds cooperative while committing to nothing.

**"That's interesting."**
Acknowledges they spoke without validating the content.

**"I see it differently."**
States your position without debating.

**"I'm not willing to discuss this right now."**
Sets a boundary on the conversation.

**"I need to go."**
Exit. Complete sentence.

**Tactic-Specific Scripts**

Now let's get specific.

---

**When they gaslight:**
"That never happened." / "You're imagining things."

Your response:
- "I trust my memory."
- "I remember it differently."
- "My perception is valid."
- "I was there. I know what happened."

Do NOT: Argue the facts. Provide evidence. Try to convince them.

---

**When they guilt trip:**
"After everything I've done for you..." / "You're so ungrateful."

Your response:
- "I appreciate you, AND I still have this boundary."
- "Those are separate things."
- "I can be grateful and still say no."
- "That doesn't change my decision."

Do NOT: List everything you've done for them. Apologize for having limits.

---

**When they shift blame:**
"You're overreacting." / "You're too sensitive."

Your response:
- "I get to decide what affects me."
- "My reaction is information."
- "This is my experience."
- "I'm comfortable with my sensitivity."

Do NOT: Prove you're not overreacting. Calibrate your reaction to their comfort.

---

**When they make threats:**
"If you do that, I'll..." / "You'll regret this."

Your response:
- (Internally: Document everything.)
- "I hear your concern."
- "That sounds like something for you to decide."
- "I'm not making decisions based on threats."
- If serious: Contact support. Make safety plans.

Do NOT: Capitulate to threats. Dismiss genuine danger signs.

---

**When they triangulate:**
"Everyone agrees with me." / "Your friend said you should..."

Your response:
- "I'm interested in what YOU think."
- "They can tell me directly if they have concerns."
- "I'll handle that relationship separately."
- "That's between me and them."

Do NOT: Defend yourself to the invisible jury.

---

**When they play victim:**
"I'm the one who's hurt here." / "You're attacking me."

Your response:
- "We can discuss your feelings after we address [the original issue]."
- "I hear you. Let's return to the topic."
- "That's not what we're talking about."
- "I'm not willing to switch topics."

Do NOT: Abandon your concern to comfort them. Accept the role reversal.

---

**When they rage:**
(Yelling, throwing things, intimidation)

Your response:
- "I won't have this conversation while you're yelling."
- "I'm leaving this room."
- "We can talk when you're calm."
- (Leave. Safety first.)

Do NOT: Try to calm them. Engage with content during rage. Stay in an unsafe situation.

---

**When they stonewall:**
(Complete shutdown, refusing to engage)

Your response:
- "When you're ready to talk, let me know."
- "I'll be here when you want to discuss this."
- (Use the space for yourself. Don't chase.)

Do NOT: Beg them to engage. Escalate to get a response. Abandon your position to restart connection.

---

**When they hoover (after you've left):**
"I've changed." / "It'll be different." / "I need you."

Your response:
- Ideally: No response. Silence is strongest.
- If you must respond: "I wish you well. My decision stands."
- "I'm not available for this conversation."

Do NOT: Engage with the content. Explain why you left. Give them material.

---

**Setting Boundaries: The Formula**

Here's a formula for boundary statements:

**"I [statement of need/limit]. If [the violation continues], I will [consequence]."**

Examples:
- "I need to be spoken to respectfully. If the yelling continues, I'll leave the room."
- "I'm not discussing my ex. If you bring it up again, I'm ending this conversation."
- "I require honesty. If I discover more lies, I'll reconsider this relationship."

The formula has three parts:
1. Clear statement of your boundary
2. Acknowledgment of what would violate it
3. Statement of what you will do (not what you want them to do)

**Following Through**

Here's the hard part: Boundaries only work if you enforce them.

If you say "I'll leave the room" and then don't leave, you've taught them that your words don't mean anything.

Before stating a boundary:
- Be certain you can follow through
- Don't bluff
- Accept that enforcement may have costs

Following through once is worth more than threatening ten times.

**When You Don't Know What to Say**

Default script for any confusing manipulation:

1. Pause. (3-3-3)
2. "I need a moment."
3. (Step away if possible)
4. "I'll think about that and get back to you."
5. (Later, when regulated, use the decoder protocol)

You don't have to have the perfect response in the moment. Buying time is a valid response.

**Practice Makes Possible**

These scripts feel unnatural at first—especially if you've been trained to over-explain, apologize, or smooth things over.

Practice out loud, alone, before you need them.

Record yourself saying: "I trust my memory." Hear how it sounds. Get comfortable with the words in your mouth.

Role-play with a trusted friend. Have them play the manipulator. Practice your responses until they feel accessible.

The goal is not to sound robotic. The goal is to have options when you're activated—responses that protect you even when you can't think clearly.

**In our next lesson,** we'll cover the Exposure Questions—strategic questions that reveal narcissistic patterns without confrontation.
