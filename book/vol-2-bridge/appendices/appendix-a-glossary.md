## Key Terms and Definitions

---

## A

**Activation**
A nervous system state characterized by heightened alertness, anxiety, or stress. In attachment contexts, activation often occurs when attachment needs are triggered but not met.

**Access Drift**
The gradual erosion of consent through incremental boundary crossings. Each individual crossing seems small and easy to dismiss, but cumulatively they reshape what's "normal" until you've lost ground you never consciously gave.

**Attachment Style**
A pattern of relating to others developed in early childhood based on caregiver responsiveness. The four main styles are: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant, and fearful-avoidant (disorganized).

**Attunement**
The capacity to sense and respond appropriately to another person's emotional state. Healthy attunement involves being present without absorbing or over-functioning.

---

## B

**Boundary**
A limit that defines where you end and another person begins. Boundaries can be physical, emotional, mental, or energetic. Healthy boundaries are flexible, clear, and maintained without aggression.

---

## C

**Calibration**
The process of testing a relationship over time to assess safety, consistency, and compatibility. Involves observing patterns rather than reacting to isolated moments.

**Co-regulation**
The process by which one person's regulated nervous system helps another person regulate. This is a primary mechanism of secure attachment.

**Cortisol**
A stress hormone released during activation. Chronic elevation indicates sustained stress or threat response.

---

## D

**Differentiation**
The capacity to maintain your own identity, thoughts, and feelings while remaining emotionally connected to others. The opposite of enmeshment.

**Disorganized Attachment**
An attachment style characterized by inconsistent or contradictory behaviors, often resulting from early experiences where caregivers were both a source of comfort and fear.

**Dissociation**
A disconnection from thoughts, feelings, surroundings, or identity. Often a protective response to overwhelming experiences.

**Dopamine**
A neurotransmitter associated with reward, pleasure, and motivation. In relationship contexts, dopamine spikes during novelty and intensity.

**Dysregulation**
A state where the nervous system is unable to maintain equilibrium. May manifest as overwhelming emotions, physical symptoms, or difficulty thinking clearly.

---

## E

**Emotional Immaturity**
Limited capacity for emotional regulation, self-awareness, and relational skills. Not a moral failing but a developmental limitation.

**Enmeshment**
A relationship pattern where boundaries are blurred, identities are fused, and individual autonomy is diminished.

---

## F

**Family Role**
A position assigned within a family system (hero, scapegoat, lost child, mascot, golden child, peacekeeper). These roles serve the family's homeostasis but often come at individual cost.

**Fast Burn**
A relationship pattern characterized by rapid intensity, quick bonding, and nervous system activation. Often feels like chemistry but functions like addiction.

**Fawning**
A trauma response characterized by people-pleasing, over-accommodation, and abandoning one's own needs to manage another person's emotional state.

**Fight/Flight/Freeze/Fawn**
The four primary trauma responses. Fight = aggression/confrontation. Flight = avoidance/escape. Freeze = immobility/shutdown. Fawn = appeasement/people-pleasing.

---

## G

**Grief**
The natural response to loss. In healing from narcissistic dynamics, grief often includes mourning the relationship, the person you hoped they'd become, and the childhood you deserved.

**Grounding**
Practices that bring attention back to the present moment and the physical body. Used to regulate the nervous system during activation.

---

## H

**Hero/Parentified Child**
A family role where the child takes on adult responsibilities, often becoming the emotional caretaker or over-achiever to stabilize the family system.

**Hypervigilance**
A state of heightened alertness and sensitivity to potential threats. Common in those who grew up in unpredictable environments.

---

## I

**Integration**
The process of incorporating new understanding and experiences into your sense of self. Healing involves integrating traumatic material so it no longer controls present behavior.

**Internal Authority**
The capacity to make decisions, trust your perception, and act from your own center without requiring external validation.

---

## L

**Love-Bombing**
An early relationship tactic characterized by excessive attention, flattery, gifts, and intensity. Often a manipulation strategy rather than genuine connection.

---

## N

**Narcissistic Dynamics**
Relational patterns characterized by lack of empathy, need for admiration, manipulation, and inability to take responsibility. Can exist on a spectrum from traits to disorder.

**Nervous System**
The body's communication network that regulates responses to the environment. The autonomic nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic branches) governs stress and relaxation responses.

**No Contact**
Complete cessation of communication with a person. Often necessary when contact itself causes harm.

---

## O

**Oxytocin**
A hormone associated with bonding, trust, and attachment. Released through positive physical contact and repeated safe interactions.

**Over-functioning**
Taking responsibility for tasks, emotions, or outcomes that belong to someone else. Often a survival strategy learned in childhood.

---

## P

**Parentified Child**
A child who was required to take on parental responsibilities—emotional caretaking, household management, or sibling care—before they were developmentally ready.

**Polyvagal Theory**
A theory (developed by Stephen Porges) explaining how the vagus nerve regulates social engagement, fight/flight, and shutdown responses based on perceived safety.

**Projection**
Attributing one's own unacknowledged feelings, thoughts, or traits to another person.

---

## R

**Regulation**
The capacity to manage one's own nervous system state—moving from activation to calm, from overwhelm to presence.

**Repair**
The process of restoring connection after rupture or conflict. Healthy repair includes acknowledgment, accountability, and changed behavior.

**Reparenting**
The practice of providing for yourself what your original caregivers could not. Includes self-soothing, self-validation, and meeting your own emotional needs.

**Rupture**
A break in connection or attunement. In healthy relationships, rupture is followed by repair.

---

## S

**Scapegoat**
A family role where one member is blamed for family problems and becomes the target of criticism, projection, or rejection.

**Secure Attachment**

**Soft Claim**
Subtle possessive moves that establish ownership through gifts, gestures, or expectations. The gift or gesture binds without asking—creating obligation where none was offered and connection where none was negotiated.
An attachment style characterized by comfort with intimacy and autonomy, ability to regulate emotions, and trust in relationships.

**Self-Abandonment**
The pattern of betraying your own needs, feelings, or values to maintain connection or avoid conflict.

**Slow Burn**
A relationship pattern characterized by gradual bonding, steady pace, and nervous system regulation. Often feels less exciting than fast burn but builds sustainable connection.

**Sovereignty**
Living from internal authority—making decisions from your own center without requiring external validation or approval.

---

## T

**Trauma Bond**
An attachment formed through cycles of intermittent reinforcement (abuse followed by relief). Characterized by intensity, loyalty despite harm, and difficulty leaving.

**Triangulation**
Using a third party to communicate, create jealousy, or manipulate dynamics in a relationship.

**Trigger**
A stimulus that activates a trauma response or emotional reaction, often disproportionate to the present situation.

---

## V

**Vagus Nerve**
The longest cranial nerve, connecting the brain to major organs. Central to the parasympathetic nervous system and social engagement.

**Ventral Vagal State**
A nervous system state associated with safety, social connection, and regulated engagement. The goal of much healing work.

---

## W

**Window of Tolerance**
The zone of optimal arousal where a person can function effectively. Outside this window, one moves into hyperarousal (fight/flight) or hypoarousal (freeze/shutdown).
