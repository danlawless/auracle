## Core Truth

> *"Leaving hurts because your body learned danger as connection."*

---

## Why Insight Isn't Enough

Understanding the patterns doesn't break them. Your nervous system was programmed through experience, and it will only reprogram through new experiences.

| What You Know | What Your Body Believes |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| "They were toxic" | "But it felt like love" |
| "I deserve better" | "But this feels like home" |
| "That behavior was wrong" | "But my body craves it" |
| "I should leave" | "But leaving feels like dying" |

**The Bridge:** New experiences of safety, not more understanding.

---

## The Four Attachment Styles

| Style | Core Fear | Survival Strategy | What You Need |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Anxious** | Abandonment | Cling, pursue, seek reassurance | Consistent presence |
| **Avoidant** | Engulfment | Distance, independence, walls | Patient, non-demanding connection |
| **Disorganized** | Both | Push-pull, chaos, confusion | Predictable safety |
| **Secure** | Manageable | Trust, repair, interdependence | *This is the goal* |

**Key insight:** Attachment styles are adaptive strategies, not personality flaws. You can learn secure attachment at any age.

## Trauma Bond vs. Love

| Trauma Bond | Secure Love |
|-------------|-------------|
| Intensity = depth | Consistency = depth |
| Relief after pain = connection | Baseline safety = connection |
| Can't imagine life without them | Can imagine life—still choose them |
| Highs and lows | Steady warmth |
| Anxious when apart | Calm when apart |
| You lose yourself | You remain yourself |
| Addictive | Nourishing |

---

## The Relief Cycle

Why leaving feels impossible:

```
TENSION → PAIN → RELIEF → BONDING → TENSION...
```

Your nervous system bonds to the **relief**, not the person. The deeper the pain, the more intense the relief, the stronger the bond.

**Breaking the cycle:** Understanding that what feels like love is actually your nervous system's addiction to relief.

---

## Slow Burn vs. Fast Burn

| Fast Burn (Trauma Pattern) | Slow Burn (Secure Pattern) |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Instant chemistry | Growing fondness |
| Can't stop thinking about them | Peaceful when apart |
| Anxiety feels like attraction | Calm feels like home |
| "This must be THE ONE" | "I want to know them better" |
| Consuming intensity | Expanding comfort |
| Rapid attachment | Gradual trust |

**The truth:** If it feels instantly like home, ask what home felt like growing up.

---

## Reparenting Basics

What you're giving yourself that you didn't receive:

| Need | Reparenting Practice |
|------|----------------------|
| **Safety** | Predictable routines, keeping promises to yourself |
| **Soothing** | Hand on heart, gentle self-talk when distressed |
| **Attunement** | Asking "What do I need right now?" and listening |
| **Validation** | "Of course you feel that way. That makes sense." |
| **Delight** | Celebrating your existence, not just your achievements |

## Window of Tolerance

```
     ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
     │   HYPERAROUSAL (Too activated)  │  Anxiety, panic, rage
     │   ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑  │
     ├─────────────────────────────────┤
     │                                 │
     │     WINDOW OF TOLERANCE         │  ← Goal: Expand this
     │     (Optimal arousal zone)      │
     │                                 │
     ├─────────────────────────────────┤
     │   ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓  │
     │   HYPOAROUSAL (Shut down)       │  Numbness, freeze, collapse
     └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Practice:** Notice when you leave your window. Name it. Use regulation tools to return.

## Co-Regulation vs. Dysregulation

| They Regulate You | They Dysregulate You |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Your nervous system calms around them | Your nervous system activates around them |
| You feel more yourself | You feel less yourself |
| Silence is comfortable | Silence is threatening |
| You can think clearly | You get foggy or frantic |
| Disagreements are survivable | Disagreements feel catastrophic |

**Choose people who regulate your nervous system, not activate it.**

## Dating After Trauma: The 90-Day Framework

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Observation** | Days 1-30 | Watch patterns, stay curious, no commitment |
| **Assessment** | Days 31-60 | Test compatibility, introduce low-stakes stress |
| **Decision** | Days 61-90 | Decide based on evidence, not chemistry alone |

**Rules:**
1. No major relationship decisions in the first 30 days
2. Watch how they handle disappointment, not just connection
3. Notice your nervous system, not just your feelings
4. Pace yourself—healthy people can wait

## Guilt After Setting Distance

Guilt after boundaries often means:

| Guilt Says | Reality Is |
|------------|------------|
| "I'm abandoning them" | "I'm protecting myself" |
| "I'm being cruel" | "I'm being honest" |
| "I should try harder" | "I've tried enough" |
| "Maybe I'm wrong" | "My body knows" |
| "Good people don't do this" | "Good people have boundaries" |

**The test:** Does the guilt feel like wisdom or programming?

---

## Clean Endings

Closure is **internal**, not conversational.

| What Won't Help | What Will Help |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Explaining yourself one more time | Accepting they won't understand |
| Getting them to admit wrongdoing | Knowing the truth for yourself |
| Making them feel your pain | Feeling your pain yourself |
| Final conversation for closure | Grief process without them |

---

## Grief Is Part of Leaving

You're grieving:
- The relationship you thought you had
- The future you imagined
- The version of them you hoped existed
- The version of yourself that could make it work
- The family/connection you wanted

**This grief is valid.** Leaving something painful can still mean losing something.
