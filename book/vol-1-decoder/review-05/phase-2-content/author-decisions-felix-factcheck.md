# FACT-CHECK DECISIONS

## Q1: Number Discrepancy - 38 Tactics vs. 37 Decoder Cards ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Status:** DISCREPANCY

**Felix's Finding:** Course references "38 manipulation tactics" but Module 4 states "37 Decoder Cards" (19 Core + 18 Advanced). Verified count: 8 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 = 38 tactics.

**Felix's Concern:** "This numerical inconsistency will confuse readers and undermine credibility."

**Clarifying Questions:**
- Are some tactics intentionally combined into single cards?
- Is there a specific tactic that doesn't have a corresponding card?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Update all references to "37 tactics" and identify which tactic to remove
- [ ] B) Update all Decoder Card references to "38 cards" (20 Core or 19 Advanced)
- [ ] C) Explain that one tactic is covered as a variation within an existing card
- [ ] D) Keep as-is and clarify in Lesson 4.1 why there are 38 tactics but 37 cards

**Felix's Preference:** C or D (explain the relationship)

**Author Decision:** _____________
**Reasoning:**
**Response to Questions:**

---

## Q2: Abuse Cycle Phases - Attribution and Accuracy

**Status:** VERIFIED with qualification needed

**Felix's Finding:** The four-phase cycle is accurate but Lenore Walker's original 1979 model had THREE phases. The reconciliation phase was added later.

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Add citation to Lenore Walker's 1979 work *The Battered Woman* in Lesson 3.1
- [ ] B) Add note that the reconciliation phase is sometimes combined with honeymoon
- [ ] C) Keep as-is since the four-phase model is now widely accepted
- [ ] D) Both A and B - credit Walker and note the evolution

**Felix's Preference:** D

**Author Decision:** _____________
**Reasoning:**

---

## Q3: Prefrontal Cortex "Goes Offline" - Scientific Accuracy

**Status:** VERIFIED with language qualification needed

**Felix's Finding:** Recent neuroscience (2025) confirms stress impairs prefrontal cortex function, particularly vmPFC. However, PFC doesn't literally "go offline"—regulatory control becomes impaired.

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Change to "prefrontal cortex function becomes impaired" for scientific accuracy
- [ ] B) Keep colloquial "goes offline" but add footnote with technical explanation
- [ ] C) First use technical language, then say "or what we might call 'going offline'"
- [ ] D) Keep as-is - the colloquial phrasing serves the educational purpose

**Felix's Preference:** B or C

**Author Decision:** _____________
**Reasoning:**

---

## Q4: Longer Exhale and Parasympathetic Activation - Add Citation

**Status:** VERIFIED - strong research support

**Felix's Finding:** STRONGLY VERIFIED. Stanford Medicine (2023) found cyclic sighing with emphasized exhalations reduces stress. PMC confirmed prolonged expiratory breathing activates parasympathetic function.

**Felix's Note:** "This is excellent, evidence-based advice. Citing the research elevates the 3-3-3 Rule from 'technique' to 'evidence-based practice.'"

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Add footnote citing Stanford Medicine 2023 cyclic sighing research
- [ ] B) Add reference to PMC study on prolonged expiratory breathing
- [ ] C) Add both Stanford and PMC citations for comprehensive support
- [ ] D) Keep as-is - common knowledge doesn't need citation

**Felix's Preference:** C

**Author Decision:** _____________
**Reasoning:**

---

## Q5: "Intermittent Reinforcement - Most Powerful" - Qualify the Claim

**Status:** VERIFIED with important qualification needed

**Felix's Finding:** Variable ratio reinforcement produces highest response rates and greatest resistance to extinction (Partial Reinforcement Extinction Effect). However, "THE most powerful" is a strong absolute claim.

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Change to "one of the most powerful bonding mechanisms in psychology"
- [ ] B) Specify "variable ratio reinforcement is the most resistant to extinction"
- [ ] C) Keep as-is with footnote explaining this refers to resistance to extinction
- [ ] D) Keep current phrasing - it's accurate enough for lay audience

**Felix's Preference:** A or B

**Clarifying Questions:**
- Do you have specific research citations that specify it as "THE most powerful"?
- Would you prefer to cite B.F. Skinner's original work on reinforcement schedules?

**Author Decision:** _____________
**Reasoning:**

---

## Q6: Trauma Bond Definition - Credit Patrick Carnes

**Status:** VERIFIED - should add attribution

**Felix's Finding:** VERIFIED: Term "trauma bond" coined by Patrick J. Carnes, Ph.D. (founder of IITAP) in 1997. Definition: "the misuse of fear, excitement, sexual feelings, and sexual physiology to entangle another person."

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Add attribution in first use: "trauma bonds (a term coined by Patrick Carnes, PhD in 1997)"
- [ ] B) Add footnote crediting Carnes and his definition

## Q7: "Gaslighting" Clinical Status - Clarify Terminology

**Status:** SOURCE CONCERN

**Felix's Finding:** "Gaslighting" originates from 1938 play/1944 film. Named most useful new word of 2016 by American Dialect Society. However, NOT officially recognized as clinical term in DSM-5.

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Add footnote: "While not a DSM-5 diagnostic term, 'gaslighting' is widely recognized by mental health professionals"
- [ ] B) Use more clinical language: "reality denial and psychological manipulation"
- [ ] C) Keep "gaslighting" but note its origin from the 1944 film in first use
- [ ] D) Keep as-is - the term is universally understood

**Felix's Preference:** A or C

**Author Decision:** _____________
**Reasoning:**

---

## Q8: "Love Bombing" Clinical Status - Similar Clarification

**Status:** SOURCE CONCERN

**Felix's Finding:** "Love bombing isn't a diagnostic term, though it is used by mental health professionals." Research support: Strutzenberg et al. (2017) "Love-bombing: A Narcissistic Approach to Relationship Formation" found strong correlation between narcissism and love-bombing behaviors.

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Add footnote noting it's a behavioral pattern, not a diagnosis
- [ ] B) Note the term's origin with the Unification Church, later applied to narcissistic abuse
- [ ] C) Keep as-is - mental health professionals widely use this term
- [ ] D) Add citation to Strutzenberg et al. (2017) research on narcissistic love bombing

**Felix's Preference:** D

**Author Decision:** _____________
**Reasoning:**

---

## Q9: Dopamine and Trauma Bonds - Verify Mechanism Claims

**Status:** VERIFIED - strong research support

**Felix's Note:** "This is one of your strongest, most evidence-based claims. Citing the research transforms it from assertion to scientific fact."

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Add citation to research on dopamine in trauma bonds
- [ ] B) Add footnote explaining the neurochemical parallel to addiction
- [ ] C) Reference specific studies on oxytocin and dopamine in abusive relationships
- [ ] D) Keep as-is - the general concept is well-established

**Author Decision:** _____________
**Reasoning:**

---

## Q10: DSM-5 NPD Criteria - Ensure Accuracy if Referenced

**Status:** VERIFIED - for informational reference

**Felix's Finding:** VERIFIED: DSM-5-TR requires 5 of 9 specific criteria for NPD diagnosis. Estimated 1-2% of U.S. population has NPD.

**Clarifying Questions:**
- Do you explicitly mention NPD diagnosis anywhere, or focus solely on recognizing manipulation tactics?
- Should the course include a disclaimer about not diagnosing others?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Add note that NPD requires 5 of 9 specific criteria diagnosed by a professional
- [ ] B) Clarify that the course addresses manipulation patterns, not clinical diagnosis
- [ ] C) Add footnote: "Narcissistic traits ≠ narcissistic personality disorder (NPD)"
- [ ] D) Keep focus on behaviors, not diagnosis

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Keep as-is - accurate evolutionary timeline
- [ ] B) Add specificity: "the limbic system evolved over millions of years"
- [ ] C) Reference Joseph LeDoux's dual-pathway threat detection research

**Author Decision:** _____________
**Reasoning:**

---

## Q13: Small Groups "50-150 People" - Dunbar's Number

**Status:** UNVERIFIED but likely referencing Dunbar's Number

**Clarifying Questions:**
- Are you specifically referencing Dunbar's Number?
- Is this about ancestral group size or cognitive relationship limits?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Add citation to Dunbar's Number (cognitive limit of ~150 stable relationships)
