## One-Line Decoders (Ready for Use)

These can be dropped directly into relevant chapters:

1. "Repair works because it teaches the body that choice will be honored—even when desire is absent."
2. "If repair costs you your pace, it isn't safe."
3. "The nervous system does not track words—it tracks consequence."
4. "I don't need to shrink my truth to keep the peace."
5. "I can take a position and remain safe."
6. "Safety comes from consented structure, not constant balance."
7. "Desire doesn't need equality. It needs trust."
8. "A replacement identity isn't about changing who you are—it's about withdrawing from roles that were never yours to carry."
9. "When spiritual communities measure progress, they reproduce the same power dynamics they claim to transcend."
10. "Control requires isolation. Collapse happens through connection."
