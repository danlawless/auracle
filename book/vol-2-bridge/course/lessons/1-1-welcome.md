### Script

Welcome to The Bridge.

You've done important work already. In Course 1, you learned to recognize manipulation patterns. You can name the tactics. You understand the playbook. You have tools for protection.

So why do you still feel stuck?

Why do you still attract the same kinds of partners? Why does safety feel boring? Why do you intellectually understand what's healthy but emotionally crave what isn't?

This course answers those questions.

**The gap between knowing and being**

There's a gap between understanding something cognitively and embodying it. You can know that a relationship is toxic and still miss it. You can recognize red flags and still feel pulled toward them. You can want security and still feel uncomfortable when you find it.

This gap isn't a character flaw. It's neurobiology.

Your nervous system was trained by experience, not by insight. It learned what safety looks like from your earliest attachments—from caregivers who may have been inconsistent, unavailable, overwhelming, or even harmful.

That training runs deeper than conscious understanding. It operates before thought.

This is why insight alone doesn't heal.

**What this course offers**

The Bridge is about crossing from survival to sovereignty.

In Course 1, you learned to SEE—to recognize patterns in real-time.

In Course 2, you'll learn to HEAL—to retrain your nervous system for secure attachment.

This involves:
- Understanding why you're attracted to what you're attracted to
- Seeing how childhood patterns shape adult choices
- Learning to make healthy contact decisions
- Grieving what you needed but didn't receive
- Dating differently after trauma
- Building genuine security through practice

The work here is slower, deeper, and more somatic than Course 1. We're not just building awareness—we're rewiring patterns.

**The core principle**

Here's the foundation of everything in this course:

**Secure attachment is not found—it is practiced.**

You won't become secure by finding the right partner. You won't heal by understanding your attachment style. You won't change by knowing what healthy looks like.

You become secure through practice. Through doing things differently. Through giving your nervous system new experiences that, over time, reshape what feels normal.

This is why the course includes a 12-week training program in Module 5. Reading about security isn't enough. You have to practice it.

**What to expect**

This course will move more slowly than Course 1.

Manipulation patterns can be learned quickly because recognition is cognitive. Attachment healing requires somatic work—body-based practices that take time to integrate.

You may feel things in this course. Old wounds may surface. Grief may arise. That's not a problem—that's the work.

Go at your own pace. Pause when you need to. Use the grounding tools you learned in Course 1.

And be gentle with yourself. You're not behind. You're exactly where you need to be.

**The bridge metaphor**

Think of yourself as standing between two lands.

Behind you is the world you knew—where love was inconsistent, emotions were overwhelming, and connection came with a cost. That world trained your nervous system. It taught you survival.

Ahead of you is a different world—where relationships regulate rather than activate, where safety is boring in a good way, where you can be close without disappearing.

This course is the bridge between those worlds.

You don't have to burn the bridge behind you. You don't have to forget where you came from. You just have to learn to walk forward.

Step by step, we'll cross together.

**In our next lesson,** we'll explore the gap between insight and healing—why knowing about patterns doesn't automatically change them, and what actually does.

Take a breath. You've already begun.

## Exercise

**Entry Reflection**

Before diving into the course content, take inventory of where you are:

**Part 1: Recognition**
1. What patterns have you recognized that you haven't been able to change?
2. What do you intellectually understand about healthy relationships that you struggle to embody?
3. What does it feel like when you encounter genuine safety?

**Part 2: History**
1. What was love like in your childhood home?
2. What did you have to do to receive attention or affection?
3. How do you see those patterns in your adult relationships?

**Part 3: Intention**
1. What do you hope to gain from this course?
2. What would be different if you could trust your own sense of safety?
3. What are you willing to practice?

- Secure attachment is practiced, not found
- This course is the bridge between survival and sovereignty
- The work is slower and more somatic than pattern recognition
