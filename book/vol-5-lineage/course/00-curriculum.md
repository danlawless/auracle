## Course Modules

### Module 1: You Are Already Enough
**Lessons:** 5 | **Duration:** ~2 hours

Foundation for healing parents. The permission to be imperfect.

| Lesson | Title | Duration |
|--------|-------|----------|
| 1.1 | The Lineage Manifesto | 15 min |
| 1.2 | You Are Already Enough | 25 min |
| 1.3 | When Your Child Activates Old Wounds | 30 min |
| 1.4 | The Rage That Rises | 30 min |
| 1.5 | Shame Spirals After Imperfect Moments | 25 min |

**Key Scripts:**

**Lesson 1.2: You Are Already Enough**
> You don't have to be fully healed to be a good parent. You have to be healing. Your children don't need perfection—they need you present, accountable, and growing. Every time you repair after a rupture, you teach them that relationships can survive mistakes. Every time you catch yourself mid-pattern and choose differently, you show them change is possible. You are already enough. Keep going.

**Lesson 1.4: The Rage That Rises**
> There's a particular rage that comes from being triggered by your child. It's not really about them. It's the volcanic eruption of old, unfelt feelings—finally having a voice. Your child does something, and suddenly you're not an adult responding to a child. You're your wounded self, flooded with everything you couldn't feel safely back then. Learning to recognize this rage—and pause before it becomes action—is essential work.

**Key Scripts:**

**Lesson 3.1: Co-Parenting With a Narcissistic Ex**
> Co-parenting with someone who manipulates is an ongoing challenge. You can't control their household. You can't protect your child from everything. What you can do: Be the stable parent. Document everything. Use parallel parenting when cooperation isn't possible. Give your child language without badmouthing. And know that your consistent presence matters more than their chaos.

### Module 4: Breaking the Chain
**Lessons:** 5 | **Duration:** ~2 hours

Generational patterns, apologies, and teaching boundaries.

| Lesson | Title | Duration |

| 4.3 | Teaching Boundaries to Children | 25 min |
| 4.4 | Raising Emotionally Literate Humans | 30 min |
| 4.5 | The Parent You're Becoming | 25 min |

**Key Scripts:**

**Lesson 4.2: The Apology They Deserve**
> When you've hurt your child—through triggered reaction, impatience, or repetition of old patterns—they deserve an apology. Not an explanation. Not a justification. An apology. "I'm sorry I yelled. That wasn't okay. You didn't deserve that. I'm working on it." This teaches them that adults can be accountable. That relationships can repair. That they're worthy of respect. Don't underestimate the power of saying sorry.
