# Appendix A: Age-Specific Scripts

## What to Say From Toddler to Teen

---

These scripts are not magic words. They are starting points—language that honors both your child's developmental reality and your own healing process.

Adapt them to your voice. Practice them when you're regulated so they're available when you're not.

**A note before you begin:** If you grew up without these words spoken to you, speaking them to your child may feel foreign. That's normal. You are learning a new language—one you were never taught. The awkwardness will fade with practice.

---

## How to Use These Scripts

1. **Find your child's age range.** Development isn't linear—use the range that fits their current capacity.
2. **Identify the situation.** Each section includes common triggering scenarios.
3. **Read the scripts out loud.** Notice which feel natural and which feel forced.
4. **Adapt to your voice.** Keep the structure, change the words.
5. **Practice when calm.** These scripts work best when they're already in your body before you need them.

---

## Developmental Reminders

Before you speak, remember:

| Age | Their Reality | Your Task |
|-----|---------------|-----------|
| 1-3 | No impulse control. Big feelings, small capacity. | Regulate for them. |
| 3-5 | Magical thinking. Egocentric. Needs repetition. | Name feelings. Model regulation. |
| 5-8 | Concrete. Fairness-focused. Sensitive to rejection. | Explain simply. Reassure belonging. |
| 8-11 | Aware of social dynamics. Beginning abstract thought. | Validate complexity. Stay curious. |
| 11-14 | Identity formation. Intense emotions. Peer-focused. | Witness without fixing. Stay steady. |
| 14-18 | Abstract reasoning. Testing autonomy. Sensitive to hypocrisy. | Respect boundaries. Model integrity. |

# Part I: Toddlers (Ages 1-3)

## The Developmental Reality

Toddlers cannot regulate themselves. They don't have tantrums to manipulate you—they have tantrums because their prefrontal cortex is still developing. They are pure nervous system with very little cognitive override.

**What this means for you:**
- You are their external regulation system
- Your calm is their calm
- Logic won't work—presence will
- Repetition is essential, not annoying

---

## When They're Melting Down

### The Basic Script

**What to say:**
- "I'm here. You're safe."
- "Big feelings. I've got you."
- "You're allowed to cry. I'm not leaving."
- "This is hard. I'm with you."

**What to do:**
- Get low (eye level or below)
- Slow your voice down
- Breathe audibly so they can hear it
- Offer touch if they want it; respect if they don't

**What NOT to say:**
- "Stop crying."
- "You're okay." (They don't feel okay)
- "Be a big boy/girl."
- "If you don't stop, [consequence]."

---

## When They Hit, Bite, or Throw

### The Limit-Setting Script

**What to say:**
- "I won't let you hit. Hitting hurts."
- "I'm going to move this so no one gets hurt."
- "You can be angry. You can't hurt people."
- "I'll keep everyone safe."

**What to do:**
- Block the hit calmly (not harshly)
- Physically remove dangerous objects
- Stay regulated—your reaction is their lesson
- Offer an alternative: "You can hit this pillow."

**After it's over:**
- "You were so angry. That's okay."
- "I still love you."
- "Let's take some breaths together."

---

## When They Won't Do What You Ask

### The Cooperation Script

**What to say:**
- "It's time to put shoes on. Would you like to do it or should I help?"
- "I know you want to play more. We're going to go now."
- "Your body is having a hard time listening. I'm going to help."

**What NOT to say:**
- "Do you want to put your shoes on?" (They'll say no)
- "If you don't come now, we're leaving you."
- "Fine, we just won't go."

**Transition support:**
- Give warnings: "Two more minutes, then we're going."
- Make it playful: "Can your shoes find your feet?"
- Validate while holding the limit: "I know. AND it's time to go."

---

## When YOU Are Triggered

### The Honest Pause Script

If you're losing it, say:
- "Mommy/Daddy needs a minute to calm down."
- "I'm going to take some breaths. You can stay here."
- "I'm feeling big feelings too. I need to help myself first."

**What this teaches them:**
- Regulation is something everyone does
- Taking space is healthy, not abandonment
- Adults have feelings too—and manage them

---

## When They're Scared

### The Reassurance Script

**What to say:**
- "I'm here. I won't let anything hurt you."
- "It's okay to feel scared. I'm with you."
- "Can you feel my hand? I'm right here."
- "The dark/noise/dog can't hurt you. I'll keep you safe."

**What to do:**
- Don't dismiss the fear ("There's nothing to be afraid of")
- Don't force confrontation
- Stay close and calm
- Let them set the pace

---

# Part II: Preschoolers (Ages 3-5)

## The Developmental Reality

Preschoolers are beginning to use language but are still driven by emotion. They believe in magical thinking, see themselves as the center of the universe (developmentally appropriate), and are highly sensitive to your emotional state.

**What this means for you:**
- They're watching your face constantly
- They take responsibility for your feelings
- They need the same message many times
- "Why" questions aren't always about answers—they're about connection

---

## When They Have Big Emotions

### The Naming Script

**What to say:**
- "You're feeling frustrated. It's hard when [specific thing happened]."
- "That looks like disappointment. You really wanted [thing]."
- "I see how angry you are. You're allowed to be angry."
- "Those are sad tears. Something sad happened."

**Why this works:**
Naming emotions helps develop the prefrontal cortex. When you say "You're angry," you're literally helping their brain wire for emotional intelligence.

**What NOT to say:**
- "You're fine."
- "That's nothing to be upset about."
- "Stop being dramatic."

---

## When They Ask About Your Feelings

### The Age-Appropriate Honesty Script

Children this age are hyper-attuned to your state. They will ask: "Mommy, are you sad?" "Why are you mad?"

**What to say:**
- "I'm feeling a little frustrated right now. It's not about you."
- "I had a hard day. I'm taking care of it."
- "Sometimes grownups feel sad too. I'm okay."
- "Thank you for noticing. I'm going to help myself feel better."

**What NOT to say:**
- Detailed explanations of adult problems
- "Nothing's wrong" (when something clearly is)
- Anything that makes them responsible for your feelings

**Key message:** Your feelings are yours to manage. They're allowed to notice without needing to fix.

---

## When They Won't Share

### The Reframe Script

**What to say:**
- "You're not ready to share that yet. That's okay."
- "It's hard to share special things. You can have a turn, then [other child] can have a turn."
- "I see you both want it. Let's figure out what to do."

**Why this matters:**
Forced sharing doesn't teach generosity—it teaches compliance. Voluntary sharing emerges from security.

---

## When They're Lying

### The Understanding Script

Preschoolers lie for different reasons than older children: sometimes it's wishful thinking, sometimes fear of your reaction, sometimes confusion between fantasy and reality.

**What to say:**
- "I know it feels better to say you didn't do it. It's still okay to tell me the truth."
- "I'm not going to be mad. I just need to know what happened."
- "It sounds like you wish that didn't happen. But it did. What do we do now?"

**What NOT to say:**
- "You're a liar."
- "I can't believe anything you say."
- Extended lectures about honesty

---

## When They Ask About Hard Things

### The Simple Truth Script

Preschoolers may ask about death, divorce, illness, or family conflict.

**Framework:**
1. Answer the question they actually asked (not the one you're afraid they meant)
2. Use simple, concrete language
3. Reassure about their safety and your presence
4. Leave space for follow-up questions

**Examples:**

*"Why doesn't Daddy live here anymore?"*
"Mommy and Daddy decided to live in different houses. We both still love you. You have two homes now."

*"Where did Grandma go?"*
"Grandma's body stopped working and she died. Her body isn't here anymore. We can still love her and remember her."

*"Why is that person scary?"*
"Some grownups are having a hard time. You're safe with me."

---

## When YOU Lose Your Temper

### The Preschooler Repair Script

Children this age are developmentally egocentric. If you yell, they may believe they caused it or that something is wrong with them.

**What to say (after you've regulated):**
- "I yelled and that wasn't okay. I'm sorry."
- "Mommy/Daddy got too frustrated. That wasn't your fault."
- "I'm learning how to calm down too. I'll keep practicing."
- "I love you. Yelling doesn't change that."

**Key:** Keep it short. Don't over-explain. Let them ask questions if they want.

---

# Part III: Early Elementary (Ages 5-8)

## The Developmental Reality

Children this age are concrete thinkers with a strong sense of fairness. They're deeply sensitive to rejection, aware of social dynamics, and forming beliefs about their own competence and worth.

- Praise and criticism shape identity

**What to say:**

**What NOT to say:**
- "Just ignore them."

**Framework:** Listen first. Validate feelings. Ask what they need. Offer guidance only when requested or clearly needed.

---

## When They Don't Want to Talk

### The Open Door Script

**What to say:**
- "You don't have to talk right now. I'm here when you're ready."

**What NOT to say:**
- "Don't talk to me that way."

**Later, when both are calm:**
"I could hear how frustrated you were. I want to understand what was happening for you."

---

## When They Witness Your Struggle

---

# Part IV: Late Elementary (Ages 8-11)

---

# Part V: Early Adolescence (Ages 11-14)

## The Developmental Reality

Early adolescence is a time of intense brain reorganization, identity formation, and emotional volatility. Peer relationships become primary. They're developing abstract thinking but inconsistently applying it.

---

# Integration: Cross-Age Principles

## Universal Truths Across All Ages

1. **Regulate yourself first.** You cannot calm a dysregulated child from your own dysregulation.

2. **Validate before you correct.** They need to feel felt before they can hear feedback.

3. **Repair is always possible.** You will mess up. The repair matters more than the rupture.

4. **Presence beats perfection.** Being there, imperfectly, is better than disappearing.

5. **Their reaction is not your report card.** You can do everything right and they can still be upset.

---

## Phrases That Work At Any Age

**For any moment of connection:**
- "I love you."
- "I'm glad you're here."
- "Tell me more."
- "What was that like for you?"

**For any moment of difficulty:**
- "We'll figure this out together."
- "I'm here."
- "This is hard. You're not alone."
- "I believe in you."

**For any moment of repair:**
- "I'm sorry. I was wrong about that."
- "I want to try again."
- "Can we have a do-over?"
- "You deserve better than how I showed up."

---

## Your Own Voice

These scripts are templates, not scripts to memorize.

The goal is to have language available when your nervous system is activated—so you can respond from intention instead of reaction.

Over time, these will become your own words. The conscious will become automatic.

That's the work.

---

*"I didn't have these words when I was a child. I'm learning them now so my child will."*
