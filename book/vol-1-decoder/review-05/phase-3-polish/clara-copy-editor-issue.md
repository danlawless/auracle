## CATEGORY 1: Terminology Consistency

### Q1: "Trauma Bond" vs "Trauma Bonding"

**Context:** Phase 2 decisions (Bailey Q11) noted the need to standardize this terminology.

**Current Usage:**
- "Trauma bond" (noun): 23 instances
- "Trauma bonding" (process): 8 instances
- "Trauma bonds" (plural): 15 instances
- "Trauma bonded" (past participle): 2 instances

**Inconsistencies Found:**
- Lesson 3.1: Uses both "trauma bond" and "trauma bonding" within same paragraph
- Lesson 2.6: "the trauma bonding process" then "this trauma bond"
- Lesson 5.2: "trauma bonded" (not used elsewhere)

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Standardize: "trauma bond" (noun), "trauma bonding process" (mechanism), never "trauma bonded"
- [ ] B) Use "trauma bond/bonds" exclusively—avoid "bonding" forms entirely
- [ ] C) Current variation is acceptable—context makes meaning clear
- [ ] D) Introduce once with both forms, then use only "trauma bond" throughout

**Editor Comments:**
Bailey's Phase 2 decision recommended clear distinction. I found the manuscript hasn't yet implemented consistent usage. Option A provides clarity while maintaining both noun and process forms. I recommend auditing all 48 instances and standardizing per your decision.

**Standardization Note:** Will add to style sheet upon decision.

### Q2: Number Discrepancy - 38 Tactics vs 37 Cards

**Context:** The course mentions both "38 manipulation tactics" and "37 decoder cards."

**Found:**
- Lesson 1.1: "We'll decode 38 specific manipulation tactics"
- Lesson 1.1: "You'll master 37 quick-reference patterns"
- Lesson 4.1: "The Decoder Cards" (count unclear in text)
- Module 2 curriculum: 38 tactics listed across lessons
- Module 4 curriculum: 37 cards referenced

**The Question:** Is this discrepancy intentional (some tactics combine into cards) or an error?

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Correct to match: Update to consistent number throughout
- [ ] B) Add clarification: Explain why numbers differ (Felix Q1 decision)
- [ ] C) This is intentional—some tactics share cards
- [ ] D) Audit actual counts and update all references

**Editor Comments:**
Felix Q1 from Phase 2 decided on Option D (clarify relationship). This has not been implemented yet. The current discrepancy may confuse readers. If intentional, add explanation in Lesson 4.1. If error, correct all references.

**Action Required:** Confirm final counts and update accordingly.

### Q3: "Decoder Protocol" vs "Decoder Process"

**Context:** The method for applying recognition is referred to inconsistently.

**Found:**
- "Decoder Protocol": 4 instances (Lesson 4.5 title, 2 body references)
- "Decoder Process": 2 instances (Lessons 4.1, 5.2)
- "The Protocol": 3 instances (no clear antecedent in some)

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Standardize to "Decoder Protocol" throughout
- [ ] B) Standardize to "Decoder Process" throughout
- [ ] C) Use "Protocol" for formal application, "process" for general reference
- [ ] D) Current variation acceptable—both terms communicate clearly

**Editor Comments:**
"Protocol" suggests a specific, repeatable procedure (which matches your content). "Process" is vaguer. Given Lesson 4.5 is titled "The Decoder Protocol," I recommend standardizing to "Protocol" throughout for consistency.

**Standardization Note:** Will add to style sheet.

### Q4: Module/Lesson Numbering References

**Context:** References to other lessons vary in format.

**Formats Found:**
- "Module 3" (standalone)
- "Lesson 3.1" (decimal)
- "Module 3, Lesson 1"
- "the next lesson"
- "later in the course"

**Inconsistencies:**
- Some forward references use specific numbers, others are vague
- No clear pattern for when to be specific vs general

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Standardize specific references: Always "Lesson X.X" for internal, "Module X" for module-level
- [ ] B) Use "Module X" only in curriculum/outlines, "Lesson X.X" in prose
- [ ] C) Current variation is natural—different contexts warrant different specificity
- [ ] D) Remove specific lesson numbers from prose—use descriptive references ("the trauma bonds lesson")

**Editor Comments:**
Specific references help readers navigate but can become outdated if structure changes (Phase 2 decisions suggest structural changes). Option D is future-proof but less precise. Option A is clear but requires maintenance. Your structural decisions from Bailey/Sage will affect this—recommend deferring final decision until restructuring is complete.

## CATEGORY 2: Punctuation and Grammar

### Q5: Serial Comma Consistency

**Context:** The manuscript mostly uses the serial comma (Oxford comma) but with exceptions.

**With Serial Comma:**
- "anger, grief, or a strange kind of relief"
- "chest, stomach, shoulders, throat"

**Without Serial Comma:**
- "see clearly, respond wisely and protect yourself"
- "confusion, self-doubt and exhaustion"

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Standardize: Always use serial comma
- [ ] B) Standardize: Never use serial comma (AP style)
- [ ] C) Current mix is acceptable—context dependent
- [ ] D) Use serial comma except before "and" in two-item lists

**Editor Comments:**
The manuscript is approximately 85% serial comma. The inconsistencies appear unintentional rather than purposeful. Option A provides clarity and matches the dominant pattern. Serial comma is recommended for educational content where clarity is paramount.

**Style Guide Decision:** Chicago Manual of Style recommends serial comma.

### Q6: Em Dash Spacing

**Context:** Em dashes appear with inconsistent spacing throughout.

**Formats Found:**
- "word—word" (no spaces): 80% of instances
- "word — word" (spaces): 15% of instances
- "word– word" (en dash with space): 5% of instances

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Standardize: No spaces around em dashes (Chicago style)
- [ ] B) Standardize: Spaces around em dashes (AP style)
- [ ] C) Current dominant pattern (no spaces) is correct—fix outliers
- [ ] D) Convert all to en dashes with spaces for cleaner reading

**Editor Comments:**
Chicago Manual recommends em dashes without spaces. The manuscript's dominant pattern is correct. I've identified 12 instances requiring correction. Will fix upon confirmation of Option A or C.

### Q7: Ellipsis Formatting

**Context:** Ellipses appear in two forms.

**Forms Found:**
- Three periods: "..." (most instances)
- Three periods with spaces: ". . ." (occasional)
- Unicode ellipsis character: "…" (rare)

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Standardize: Three periods no spaces "..."
- [ ] B) Standardize: Three periods with spaces ". . ." (Chicago)
- [ ] C) Use Unicode ellipsis character "…" throughout
- [ ] D) Current mix acceptable—all read as ellipsis

**Editor Comments:**
For digital publication, Option A or C is cleanest. Chicago prefers spaced periods for print, but three periods (Option A) is more common in digital formats. Unicode ellipsis (Option C) is typographically correct but may have rendering issues in some formats.

### Q8: Colon Capitalization

**Context:** Text following colons varies in capitalization.

**Capitalized After Colon:**
- "Here's the thing: You can understand everything"
- "Here's what I want you to know: You are not crazy"

**Lowercase After Colon:**
- "The goal is clear: understand the pattern"
- "One word: relief"

**Current Pattern:**
Capitalized when followed by complete sentence, lowercase for fragments.

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Confirm current pattern (capitalize complete sentences)
- [ ] B) Never capitalize after colon (AP style)
- [ ] C) Always capitalize after colon for consistency
- [ ] D) Audit and fix—some instances don't follow the apparent pattern

**Editor Comments:**
The current pattern (capitalize complete sentences) follows Chicago Manual and is mostly consistent. I found 3 instances where complete sentences follow colons but are lowercase. Will correct these if you confirm Option A.

## CATEGORY 3: Number and Format Standardization

### Q9: Number Formatting (Spelled vs Numeric)

**Context:** Numbers appear in various formats.

**Patterns Found:**
- Spelled out: "five modules," "three phases," "four counts"
- Numeric: "38 tactics," "37 cards," "10 hours," "30 minutes"
- Time-specific: "4-4-8-4" (breath count), "5-4-3-2-1" (grounding)
- Mixed: "ten hours" and "10 hours" (same reference, different locations)

**Standard Rule Applied:**
Spell out one through ten, use numerals for 11+.

**Exceptions Found:**
- "5 things you can see" (should be "five"?)
- "ten hours" in 1.1 but "10 hours" in curriculum

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Strict rule: Spell out 1-10, numerals 11+, except technical (breath counts)
- [ ] B) Context-based: Numerals in exercises/protocols, spelled in prose
- [ ] C) All numerals for consistency and readability
- [ ] D) Current mix acceptable—readers understand both

**Editor Comments:**
Option B aligns with the manuscript's intuitive pattern: exercises use numerals for quick reference ("Name 5 things"), prose uses words for flow ("five modules"). This is practical and reader-friendly. Will audit and standardize per decision.

### Q10: Time/Duration Formatting

**Context:** Lesson durations and time references vary.

**Formats Found:**
- "15 minutes" (numeric + spelled unit)
- "30 min" (numeric + abbreviated)
- "2-3 minutes" (range)
- "Five minutes" (fully spelled)

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Standardize: Numeric + spelled unit (15 minutes)
- [ ] B) Standardize: Numeric + abbreviated (15 min)
- [ ] C) Spelled for small durations (five minutes), numeric for larger (30 minutes)
- [ ] D) Current variation acceptable for context

**Editor Comments:**
Lesson headers consistently use "15 minutes," "30 minutes" format. Practice sections vary more. Recommend Option A for clarity throughout, matching the established lesson header format.

### Q11: Course Duration Total

**Context:** Felix Q14 from Phase 2 flagged the "~10 hours" claim needs recalculation.

**Current Claims:**
- Lesson 1.1: "Over the next ten hours"
- Curriculum: Sum of lesson durations
- Marketing/intro materials: Various references

**Issue:** With Phase 2 structural changes (new Module 6, split lessons), duration will change.

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Calculate new duration after restructuring, update all references
- [ ] B) Use approximate: "approximately 10-12 hours" for flexibility
- [ ] C) Remove specific duration claims—let readers discover
- [ ] D) Mark as TBD pending structural implementation

**Editor Comments:**
This is dependent on Phase 2 implementation. Marking as TBD until Module 6 creation and lesson splits are complete, then recalculate. Don't update until structure is finalized.

## CATEGORY 4: Internal Consistency

### Q12: Phase Terminology for Abuse Cycle

**Context:** The abuse cycle phases are named inconsistently.

**In Lesson 3.1:**
- "Phase 1: Tension Building"
- "Phase 2: Incident"
- "Phase 3: Reconciliation"
- "Phase 4: Calm (Honeymoon)"

**Elsewhere:**
- "Honeymoon phase" (without Calm)
- "The incident phase" vs "the incident"
- "Reconciliation" vs "making up"

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Standardize to exact terms from 3.1 throughout
- [ ] B) Allow variation in casual references, exact terms in formal explanations
- [ ] C) Simplify to consistent shorthand: "tension, incident, honeymoon"
- [ ] D) Current variation acceptable—core terms are consistent

**Editor Comments:**
Lesson 3.1's terminology is the authoritative source. Informal references ("honeymoon phase," "making up") should be understood as pointing to these formal terms. Option B allows natural prose while maintaining formal accuracy where it matters. Will create cross-reference in style sheet.

### Q13: Decoder Card Naming Conventions

**Context:** Decoder cards have names that appear in various formats.

**Formats Found:**
- "The Gaslight" (title case with "The")
- "Gaslighting" (without "The")
- "Card 23: The Extinction" (numbered)
- "the extinction card" (lowercase)

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Standardize: Always "The [Name]" (title case) when referring to cards
- [ ] B) Standardize: Just "[Name]" without article, title case
- [ ] C) Numbered format in Module 4 only, name-only elsewhere
- [ ] D) Current variation acceptable—context clarifies

**Editor Comments:**
Decoder cards are a key branded element. Consistent naming strengthens recognition. Option A ("The Gaslight," "The Triangulator") treats them as proper noun titles. Option C provides full reference in Module 4 but cleaner prose elsewhere. Recommend A for brand consistency.

### Q14: Resource/Safety Information

**Context:** Felix Q15 flagged the need to verify safety resources.

**Resources Listed:**
- National DV Hotline: 1-800-799-7233
- Website: thehotline.org (mentioned in Felix decision)
- Crisis resources in Lesson 2.4

**Verification Needed:**
- Phone number current and correct
- Website URL active
- Any accessibility options (text line, chat)

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Verify and update all resource information before publication
- [ ] B) Include multiple resources with verification dates
- [ ] C) Link to a maintained resource page rather than static numbers
- [ ] D) Mark for pre-publication verification check

**Editor Comments:**
Safety resources must be accurate. The National DV Hotline number is correct as of this review. Their text option (text START to 88788) and chat (thehotline.org) should be added per accessibility needs. Recommend verifying immediately before any publication.

**Verified:** 1-800-799-7233 is current. Text: "START" to 88788. Chat: thehotline.org.

### Q15: Lesson Structure Elements

**Context:** Lessons have structural elements with varying presence.

**Standard Elements:**
- Video Script header
- Duration
- Module/Type
- Script content
- Exercise section
- Key Concepts
- Notes for AI Narrator

**Inconsistencies:**
- Some lessons missing "Type" designation
- Exercise section format varies (bulleted vs numbered vs prose)
- "Closing" section presence varies

**Options:**
- [ ] A) Standardize all structural elements across all lessons
- [ ] B) Required: Duration, Script, Exercise, Key Concepts. Optional: others
- [ ] C) Current variation acceptable—content matters more than format
- [ ] D) Create lesson template and audit against it

**Editor Comments:**
Structural consistency improves both reader experience and production workflow. Option D is the most thorough: create a template, audit all lessons, note intentional variations. This is lower priority than content edits but valuable for long-term maintenance.
